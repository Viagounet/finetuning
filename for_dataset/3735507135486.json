Since the document is likely to be long, given the number of words and chunks, I will start by reading the first chunk to get an idea of how the document is structured. This should give me an indication of the main parts or sections that the document is divided into.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/4.pdf', 0)</s>"}
