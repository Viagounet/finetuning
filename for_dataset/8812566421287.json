You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to Translate the conclusion into Spanish.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/14.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: - Learned:\n  - The user's goal is to translate the conclusion of a document into Spanish.\n  - The document is a PDF with the path \"papiers/14.pdf\" and contains 14988 words, 121099 letters, and is divided into 62 chunks.\n  - The chunks read (58 to 61) contain references and parts of the content related to hydrogen energy systems, storage, transportation, and various studies on the topic.\n  - The conclusion has not been located yet, as the chunks provided are from the references section and do not contain the concluding statements.\n\n- To fulfill the request:\n  - Need to locate the actual conclusion of the document, which might be in one of the final chunks that have not been read yet.\n  - Once the conclusion is found, it will need to be translated into Spanish to complete the user's goal.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/14.pdf', 57]\nOutput: SunZ-F, Zhao L, Wu K-K, Wang 2-H, Wu J, Chen C, etal\nOverview of recent progress in exogenous hydrogen supply\nbiogas upgrading and future perspective.
