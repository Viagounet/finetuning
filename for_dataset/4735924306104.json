This paper instead discusses an unpredictable\nphenomenon that we refer to as emeryent abilities of large language models. We cousider an\nability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models,\ncannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of\nuch emergence raises the question of whether additional\nscaling could potentially further expand the range of capabilities of language models\n1 Introduction\nLanguage models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. It is now well-known\nthat increasing the scale of language models (e.g., training compute, model parameters, etc.) can lead to\nbetter performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown\nct al., 2020, inter alia). In many the effect of scale on performance can often be methodologically\npredicted via scaling laws\u2014for example, scaling curves for cross-entropy loss have been shown to empirically\nspan more than seven orders of magnitude \n- Action 3: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/5.pdf', 1]\nOutput: (Kaplanet al., 2020: Hoffmann et al., 2022). On the other hand,\nperformance for certain downstream tasks counterintuitively does not appear to continnously improve as &\nfunction of scale, and such tasks cannot be predicted ahead of time (Ganguli et al., 2022).\nIn this paper, we will discuss the unpredictable phenomena of emergent abilities of large language models\nEmergence as an idea has been long discussed in domains such as physics, biology, and computer science\n(Anderson, 1972; Hwang et al., 2012: Forrest, 1990; Corradini & O'Comnor, 2010; Harper & Lewis, 2012, inter\n\nPublished in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (08/2022)\nalia). We will consider the following general definition of emergence, adapted from Steinhardt (2022) and\nrooted in a 1972 essay called \u201cMore Is Different\u201d by Nobel prize-winning physicist Philip Anderson (Anderson,\n1972):\nEmergence is when quantitative changes in a system result in qualitative changes in behavior.\nHere we will explore emergence with respect to model scale, as measured by training compute and number of\nmodel parameters. Specifically, we define emergent abilities of large language models as abilities that are\nnot present in smaller-scale models but are present in large-scale models; thns they cannot be predicted by\nsimply extrapolating the performance improvements on smaller-scale models (\u00a72).' We survey emergent\nabilities as observed in a range of prior work, categorizing them in settings such as few-shot prompting (\u00a73)\nand augmented prompting strategies (\u00a74). Emergence motivates future research on why such abilities are\nacquired and whether more scaling will lead to further emergent abilities, which we highlight as important\nquestions for the field (\u00a75).\nAs a broad concept, emergence is often used informally and can be reasonably interpreted in many different\nways. In this paper, we will consider a focused definition of emergent abilities of large language models:\nAn ability is emergent if it \u00e9s not present in smaller models but is present in larger models\nEmergent abilities would not have been directly predicted by extrapolating a scaling law (ie. consistent\nperformance improvements) from small-scale models. When visualized via a scaling curve (2-axis: model\nscale, y-axis: performance), emergent abilities show a clear pattern performance is near-random until a\ncertain critical threshold of scale \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The previous actions have provided two chunks of the document, and within these chunks, there are several spelling mistakes that can be identified. To continue identifying possible spelling mistakes, I will proceed to read the next chunk of the document. By reading the document chunk by chunk, I can systematically go through the entire document and identify all spelling errors.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/5.pdf', 2)</s>"}
