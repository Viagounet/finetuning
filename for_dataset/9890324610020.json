Energy\nefficiency-related actions could play an important role in\nachieving climate mitigation goals and sustainable develop-\nment targets [2]. Among the Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) of the United Nations, energy and climate activities are\nseen as essential objectives [3]. In particular, SDG 13 promotes\nefforts toward climate action, in accordance with the Paris\nAgreement. Improvements in energy efficiency and sustain-\nable infrastructures are the core of SDG 7, dealing with the\n\u201cpromotion of affordable and clean energy\u2019 [1,5]. The SDG 9\ntargets aim to develop resilient infrastructures and sustainable\nindustrialization, employing innovation. Nowadays, these ac-\ntions have been also considered potential key factors to tackle\nthe energy issues raised during the COVID-19 emergency [5,7]\n\u2018This is especially due to the problems related to pollution,\nincluding climate change and the high emission of carbon di-\noxide into the air, together with other polluting elements, the\ncauses of which are various and which certainly include the\nconsumption \n- Action 4: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/14.pdf', 2]\nOutput: offossil fuels [8,0]. Moreover, due to the energy\nefficiency conundrum and other hurdles, renewable energy-\nbased generation systems have not reached their sufficient\nenergy saving and GHG emission reduction potentials in\nEurope. Such climate change countermeasures may reduce\nenergy poverty and apply the energy equity principle, thus\nresearchers and policymakers should pay greater attention to\nthem. Several researchers analyzed energy poverty and\nclimate change mitigation in EU homes based on a thorough\nliterature analysis and recommends further research and\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\npolicy. Streimikiene et al. [10, 11] proposed an integrated\nframework for tackling energy poverty, carbon-free energy\ntransition, and climate change mitigation in the EU. In addi-\ntion, more targeted climate change policies and interventions\nare needed to minimize energy poverty and achieve climate\nchange mitigation potential connected to household energy\nusage, Kyriakopoulos and Arabatzis [12] addressed the same\nissues focusing on energy storage technologies.\nGlobally, in the last 100 years, carbon dioxide emissions\nhave increased exponentially around the globe, achieving\nmore than 30 Gt [13]. Among the emissions caused by the use\nof fossil fuels, a large part comes from the use of the latter in\ntransport. In fact, this sector represented 25% of total carbon\ndioxide emissions in 2018, with an increase of 10% compared\nto 1990, At the European level, greenhouse gas emissions,\nshown in Fig, 1a, have decreased overall in recent years, but\nhave increased in the road transport sector, from about 17% of\ntotal emissions in 1990 to about 30% in 2019 [14], as depicted in\nFig. 1b. The scale of the public health crisis caused by air\npollution and the importance of the energy sector to its res-\nolution are the reasons why several governmental agencies\nare focusing on this critical topic, which is of interest to the\nwhole scientific community, too [15,16]. The industrial\ndevelopment model followed so far has led to the abuse of\nfossil energy resources. For many years it was believed the\nonly model of development was that one linked to a contin-\nuous increase in the production and consumption of energy\n[17]. This model has proved insufficient \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify all possible spelling mistakes, I will need to read through the entire document.
