However, to understand the main parts of the document, we need to read further into the document to identify sections such as the introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. Since the document is divided into 29 chunks, I will continue reading the subsequent chunks to gather information about the main parts of the document.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/2.pdf', 1)</s>"}
