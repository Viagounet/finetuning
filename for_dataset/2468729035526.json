In the present article, we aim to\nquantify the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model, across its life\ncycle. We estimate that BLOOM\u2019s final training emitted approximately 24.7 tonnes of COseq if\nwe consider only the dynamic power consumption, and 50.5 tonnes if we account for all processes\nranging from equipment manufacturing to energy-based operational consumption. We also carry out\nan empirical study to measure the energy requirements and carbon emissions of its deployment for\ninference via an API endpoint receiving user queries in real-time. We conclude with a discussion\nregarding the difficulty of precisely estimating the carbon footprint of ML models and future research\ndirections that can contribute towards improving carbon emissions reporting.\nKeywords: carbon footprint, language modeling, life cycle assessment, machine learning.\n1, Introduction\nClimate change is one of our generation\u2019s biggest challenges, impacting ecosystems and livelihoods\nacross the world; estimating and reducing our carbon emissions is an important part of mitigating its\nimpacts (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). According to recent estimates, the global CO; emissions\nof the information and communications technology (ICT) sector account for around 2% of global\nCO; emissions, but this figure is hard to estimate precisely given the distributed nature of global\ncomputing infrastructure (International Telecommunication Union 2020, Malmodin and Lund\u00e9n\n2018; Copenhagen Centre on Energy Efficiency. 2020), The infrastructure used for training and\ndeploying machine learning (ML) models contributes to this number, \n- Action 3: read_chunk\nArguments: ['/papers/papiers/1.pdf', 1]\nOutput: butthe exact extent of this\ncontribution is also unclear.

The current study describes the first\nattempt to estimate the broader carbon footprint of an LLM, including the emissions produced by\nmanufacturing the computing equipment used for its training as well as the model deployment via\nan API. The goal of our study is not to hone in on an exact number for the emissions produced,\nbut to provide estimates of the relative contribution of each step of the deployment process towards\nthe overall emissions of the model. We conclude with a discussion about the carbon emissions of\ndifferent LLMs as well as the BigScience workshop overall, and propose directions for future work\nto both quantify and report these emissions.\n2. Related Work\nThere are different aspects of the environmental impact of computing in general and machine learning\nin particular that are relevant to our study; we briefly describe existing relevant work in the paragraphs\nbelow.\nEmpirical Studies on ML CO; Emissions Most of the existing work in this area has been done\non estimating the CO\u00bb emissions incurred during model training. Starting with the seminal work\nof Strubell et al., who looked at the carbon footprint of training a Transformer model (2019), more\nrecent studies have also looked at other model architectures and their ensuing emissions (Patterson\net al,, 2021; Naidu et al., 2021), Other studies have pursued a broader analysis of trends in terms\nof the energy requirements and CO) emissions of ML models in general (Thompson et al., 2020\nWu \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To provide a comprehensive summary of the document, I need to understand its overall structure and content. I have information about the introduction and related work sections from the first two chunks. To get a better grasp of the document's structure, I will continue reading the subsequent chunks. This will allow me to identify the main parts of the document, the language used, the motivations behind the study, and the authors' conclusions or discussions. Once I have a clearer picture of the content, I can then suggest improvements and provide examples of similar documents that could serve as useful references.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/1.pdf', 2)</s>"}
