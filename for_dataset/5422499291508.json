{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to identify all the possible spelling mistakes.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/5.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The user wants to identify all possible spelling mistakes in the provided text.\n- The text is from a PDF document, specifically 'papers/papiers/5.pdf'.\n- The document has been read in chunks, and four chunks have been provided so far.\n- The text includes academic content related to large language models and emergent abilities.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- I need to continue reviewing the text provided in the chunks to identify any spelling mistakes.\n- If there are additional chunks of the document that have not been read, they should be reviewed as well to ensure all spelling mistakes are identified throughout the entire document.\n- Once all spelling mistakes are identified, they should be reported back to the user.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Before identifying spelling mistakes, I need to know how many chunks the document has so I can systematically go through each one. This will ensure that I don't miss any part of the document. To get this information, I will use the metadata function on the provided document path.\n\nAction: metadata(\"papers/papiers/5.pdf\")</s>"}
