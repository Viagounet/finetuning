{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to summarize what this document is and what it talks about.\nMore precisely, I want you to tell me the overall structure of the document (what are the main parts? what language? what are the motivations? who's the author?)\nThen I want you to tell me more about the document content and to give example of similar documents that could be useful as references.\nFinally, I want you to propose improvements on the document. Please give a rather in-depth answer..\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/2.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n\n- The document is a scientific article about a new electrochemical carbon capture technology.\n- The main parts of the document include an introduction to the technology, its advantages, and a comparison with existing technologies.\n- The language used is technical and scientific, with terminology specific to chemistry and engineering.\n- The motivations behind the document are to present a novel method for carbon capture that addresses the limitations of current technologies.\n- The authors of the document are a team of researchers from various institutions, including Rice University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n- The document discusses a solid-electrolyte reactor design that captures CO2 efficiently, with high purity output, and without the need for chemical inputs or generation of side products.\n- The document also compares the new technology to existing carbon capture methods, highlighting its advantages in terms of energy efficiency, scalability, and adaptability.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n\n- A more detailed summary of the document content, including specific findings, results, and conclusions.\n- Examples of similar documents that could serve as references or provide additional context.\n- A proposal for improvements on the document, which could include suggestions for clarifying complex sections, expanding on certain points, or addressing potential limitations of the study.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_document\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/2.pdf']\nOutput: An error has occured: name 'folder' is not defined\n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Before I can summarize the document in detail, I need to know its structure and content. To do this, I will use the metadata function to get an overview of the document's structure, such as the number of pages and chunks. This will help me plan how to approach reading and summarizing the document.\n\nAction: metadata(\"papers/papiers/2.pdf\")</s>"}
