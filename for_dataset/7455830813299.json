In the present article, we aim to\nquantify the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model, across its life\ncycle. We estimate that BLOOM\u2019s final training emitted approximately 24.7 tonnes of COseq if\nwe consider only the dynamic power consumption, and 50.5 tonnes if we account for all processes\nranging from equipment manufacturing to energy-based operational consumption. We also carry out\nan empirical study to measure the energy requirements and carbon emissions of its deployment for\ninference via an API endpoint receiving user queries in real-time. We conclude with a discussion\nregarding the difficulty of precisely estimating the carbon footprint of ML models and future research\ndirections that can contribute towards improving carbon emissions reporting.\nKeywords: carbon footprint, language modeling, life cycle assessment, machine learning.\n1, Introduction\nClimate change is one of our generation\u2019s biggest challenges, impacting ecosystems and livelihoods\nacross the world; estimating and reducing our carbon emissions is an important part of mitigating its\nimpacts (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). According to recent estimates, the global CO; emissions\nof the information and communications technology (ICT) sector account for around 2% of global\nCO; emissions, but this figure is hard to estimate precisely given the distributed nature of global\ncomputing infrastructure (International Telecommunication Union 2020, Malmodin and Lund\u00e9n\n2018; Copenhagen Centre on Energy Efficiency. 2020), The infrastructure used for training and\ndeploying machine learning (ML) models contributes to this number, \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The user's request is to identify all possible spelling mistakes in the document. The metadata function has already been used to gather information about the document, and the first chunk of the document has been read. To continue with the task, I will read the next chunk of the document to analyze it for spelling mistakes. Since the index for chunks starts at 0 and we have already read chunk 0, the next chunk to read is chunk 1.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/1.pdf', 1)</s>"}
