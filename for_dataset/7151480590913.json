However, limited research has evaluated green\nspace demand specifically in terms of carbon storage and carbon emissions. This study introduces\na novel methodological framework that aligns ecosystem service functions with both supply and\ndemand, considering carbon storage and carbon emissions as crucial perspectives. The goal was\nto develop a comprehensive approach to assess the matching between the supply and demand of\ngreen spaces based on their carbon-related ecosystem services. The following research questions\nwere developed to guide this study: (1) What are the spatial and temporal characteris\nstorage? (2) What are the spatiotemporal variations in carbon emissions on a city scale? (3) How does\na \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To write a comprehensive report for fellow scientists, I need to gather detailed information about the study's methodology, findings, implications, and the authors' recommendations. Since the document is 24 chunks long, I will continue reading the document chunk by chunk to extract the necessary information. I will start with chunk 1, as chunk 0 provided the introduction and abstract.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/15.pdf', 1)</s>"}
