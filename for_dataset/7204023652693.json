The conclusion is typically located towards the end of a document, but not necessarily in the very last chunk if the document includes references or appendices. Therefore, I will attempt to read the chunk before the ones that have been checked (chunk 21 and 22), which is chunk 20, to see if the conclusion can be found there.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/388.pdf', 19)</s>"}
