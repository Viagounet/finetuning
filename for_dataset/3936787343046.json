You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to Translate the conclusion into Spanish.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with.

The last two chunks read from the document (chunks 16 and 17) contain references and part of the bibliography, which typically come at the end of academic papers. However, the actual conclusion might be in the chunk before the references, which would be chunk 15. To find the conclusion, I will read chunk 15 of the document.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/12.pdf', 15)</s>"}
