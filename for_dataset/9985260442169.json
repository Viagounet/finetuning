{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to summarize what this document is and what it talks about.\nMore precisely, I want you to tell me the overall structure of the document (what are the main parts? what language? what are the motivations? who's the author?)\nThen I want you to tell me more about the document content and to give example of similar documents that could be useful as references.\nFinally, I want you to propose improvements on the document. Please give a rather in-depth answer..\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/5.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n\n- The document is a PDF titled \"Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models,\" authored by a team from Google Research, Stanford University, UNC Chapel Hill, and DeepMind.\n- It was published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research in August 2022 and is available on arXiv.\n- The document discusses the phenomenon of emergent abilities in large language models, which are abilities not present in smaller models but appear as the model scales.\n- The overall structure includes an abstract, introduction, and sections discussing few-shot prompting, augmented prompting strategies, and future research directions.\n- The language of the document is academic and technical, focused on the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).\n- The motivation behind the document is to explore and define the concept of emergent abilities in large language models, which cannot be predicted by simply scaling up smaller models.\n- The document contains references to other works and includes figures and examples to illustrate the concept of emergent abilities.\n- The document also discusses the importance of factors like training computation, model parameters, and dataset size in the emergence of new abilities in language models.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n\n- A more detailed summary of the document content, including key findings and examples provided in the document.\n- Examples of similar documents that could be useful as references for further understanding the topic.\n- Suggestions for improvements on the document based on its content, structure, and presentation.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_document\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/5.pdf']\nOutput: An error has occured: name 'folder' is not defined\n- Action 2: read_document\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/5.pdf']\nOutput: An error has occured: name 'folder' is not defined\n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Since the previous attempts to read the document resulted in an error due to an undefined 'folder', I will attempt to read the document again using the correct path to ensure that I can provide a detailed summary of the content, find similar documents for reference, and suggest improvements.\n\nAction: read_document(\"papers/papiers/5.pdf\")</s>"}
