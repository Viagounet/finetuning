{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to identify all the possible spelling mistakes.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/1.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The user wants to identify all possible spelling mistakes in a document.\n- The document is a PDF titled \"Estimating the Carbon Footprint of BLOOM, a 176B Parameter Language Model.\"\n- The document has been partially read in chunks, and the text from these chunks has been provided.\n- There have been no specific actions taken yet to identify spelling mistakes in the text provided.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- I need to analyze the text provided from the chunks of the document to identify any spelling mistakes.\n- If there are additional chunks of the document that have not been read, they would also need to be analyzed for spelling mistakes to complete the user's request.\n- A summary of all identified spelling mistakes should be provided to the user once the analysis is complete.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Before identifying spelling mistakes, I need to know the structure of the document to determine how many chunks there are and how to proceed with reading them. This will help me to plan the analysis of the entire document for spelling errors. Therefore, I will use the metadata function to get information about the document.\n\nAction: metadata(\"papers/papiers/1.pdf\")</s>"}
