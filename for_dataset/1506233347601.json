You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to What are the main parts of the document?.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with.

Although most systems use sentences as units, some work with larger passages,\ntypically paragraphs. Typically, a set of features is computed for each passage, and\nultimately these features are normalized and summed. The passages with the highest\nresulting scores are sorted and returned as the extract.\nEarly techniques for sentence extraction computed a score for each sentence based\nfn features such as position in the text (Baxendale 1958; Edmundson 1969), word\nand phrase frequency (Luhn 1958), key phrases (e.g, \u201cit is important to note\u201d) (Ed-\nmundson 1969). Recent extraction approaches use more sophisticated techniques for\ndeciding which sentences to extract; these techniques often rely on machine learning,\nto identify important features, on natural language analysis to identify key passages,\nor on relations between words rather than bags of words.\nThe application of machine learning to summarization was pioneered by Kupiec,\nPedersen, and Chen (1995), who developed a summarizer using a Bayesian classifier\nto combine features from a corpus of scientific articles and their abstracts. Aone et\nal, (1999) and Lin (1999) experimented with other forms of machine learning and its\neffectiveness. Machine learning has also been applied to learning individual features;\nfor example, Lin and Hovy (1997) applied machine learning to the problem of de-\ntermining how sentence position affects the selection of sentences, and Witbrock and\nMittal (1999) used statistical approaches to choose important words and phrases and\ntheir syntactic context.\n400\nRadev, Hovy, and McKeown Summarization: Introduction\nApproaches involving more sophisticated natural language analysis to identify key\npassages rely on analysis either of word relatedness or of discourse structure, Some\nresearch uses the degree of lexical connectedness between potential passages and the\nremainder of the text; connectedness may be measured by the number of shared words,\nsynonyms, or anaphora (eg., Salton et al. 1997; Mani and Bloedor 1997; Barzilay\nand Elhadad 1999). Other research rewards passages that include topic words, that is,\nwords that have been determined to correlate well with the topic of interest to the user\n(for topic-oriented summaries) or with the general theme of the source text (Buckley\nand Cardie 1997; Strzalkowski et \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The previous action provided information from chunk 2 of the document, which discussed early techniques for sentence extraction and the application of machine learning to summarization. To continue identifying the remaining sections and subsections of the document, I will read the next chunk of the document. This will help to provide a comprehensive understanding of the document's structure and the topics covered in subsequent sections.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/12.pdf', 3)</s>"}
