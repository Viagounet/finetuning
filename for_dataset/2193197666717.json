Since the document is 40 chunks long, I will start by reading the first few chunks to locate the beginning sections such as the abstract, introduction, and possibly the methodology. This will give me an idea of how the document is organized and where to find the subsequent sections.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/11.pdf', 1)</s>"}
