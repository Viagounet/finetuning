Every second, humanity generates enough words to fill a library of Babel, and the surge shows no signs of slowing. But fear not, for a savior emerges from the silicon: Automatic Summarization Techniques!\n\nThese cutting-edge algorithms are our digital David against the Goliath of information overload. With the power to distill vast epics into digestible nuggets, they promise to keep us afloat in the relentless tide of data. Imagine the entirety of \"War and Peace\" reduced to a tweet, or the day's news crunched into a bite-sized snack\u2014this is no longer the stuff of science fiction!\n\nAs we stand on the brink of a new era, where every keystroke adds to the textual tempest, these AI-powered marvels work tirelessly. They parse, they analyze, they synthesize, transforming the chaotic cacophony of the internet into a symphony of succinctness.\n\nPrepare to witness the revolution of reading, as automatic summarization techniques redefine knowledge consumption. The explosion of text data has met its match, and the future of information is here, concise and clear. Hold on to your hats, readers, for the age of information inundation is over, and the dawn of distilled data is upon us!\n- Action 4: read_chunk\nArguments: ['/papers/papiers/4.pdf', 1]\nOutput: advantageandthat eopies earths notice andthe fll tation\n\u2018the ist page, Copyrights for tid-party components ofthis work nut be nated\nFall other uses contact the ower authors)\naX, July 2017 USA\n\u00a9 2017 Copyright held by the owner author(s)\nACM SBN d7B-xsexe asa YY/MIM,..18.00\ntps: doiong/\u00a56.114Sinnanann nanan\n\u2018This expanding availability of documents has demanded exhaus-\ntive research in the area of automatic text summarization. Accord-\ning to Radef et al. (53] a summary is defined as \u201ca text that is pro-\nduced from one or more texts that conveys important information\nin the original texts), and that is no longer than half of the original\ntext(s) and usualy, significantly less than that\u201d\n\u2018Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise\nand fluent summary while preserving key information content and\noverall meaning. In recent years, numerous approaches have been\ndeveloped for automatic text summarization and applied widely in\nvarious domains. For example, search engines generate snippets\nas the previews of the documents (73). Other examples include\nnews websites which produce condensed descriptions of news top-\nics usually as headlines to facilitate browsing or knowledge extrac-\ntive approaches (8, 61,72}\n\u2018Automatic text summarizationis very challenging, because when\n\u2018weas humans summarize apiece of text, we usually read it entirely\ntodevelop our understanding, and then write a summary highlight-\ning its main points, Since computers lack human knowledge and\nlanguage capability, it makes automatic text summarization a very\ndifficult and non-trivial task.\n\u2018Automatic text summarization gained attraction as early asthe\n1950s. An important research of these days was (38] for summariz~\ning scientific documents. Luhn et al. (38] introduced a method to\nextract salient sentences from the text using features such as word\nand phrase frequency. They proposed to weight the sentences of\na document as a function of high frequency words, ignoring very\nhigh frequency common words. Edmundson etal. (23] described a\nparadigm based on key phrases which in addition to standard fre~\nquency depending weights, used the following three methods to\ndetermine the sentence weight:\n(1) Cue Method: The relevance ofa sentence \n- Action 5: read_chunk\nArguments: ['/papers/papiers/4.pdf', 2]\nOutput: iscalculated based\non the presence or absence of certain cue words inthe cue\ndictionary.\narXi, July 2017, USA\n(2) Title Method: The weight of a sentence is computed as\nthe sum ofall the content words appearing inthe title and\nheadings ofa tex.\n(8) Location Method: This method assumes that sentences ap-\npearing in the beginning of document as well as the begin-\nning of individual paragraphs have a higher probability of\nbeing relevant.\nSince then, many works have been published to address the\nproblem of automatic text summarization (see [24, 26] for more\ninformation about more advanced techniques until 2000s)\nIngeneral, there are two different approaches for automatic sum-\n\u2018marization: extraction and abstraction. Extractive summarizationmeth-\nods work by identifying important sections of the text and gener-\nating them verbatim: thus, they depend only on extraction of sen-\ntences from the original text. In contrast, abstractive summariza-\ntion methods aim at producing important material in a new way. In\nother words, they interpret and examine the text using advanced\nnatural language techniques in order to generate a new shorter\ntext that conveys the most critical information from the original\ntext. Even though summaries created by humans are usually not\nextractive, most of the summarization research today has focused\non extractive summarization, Purely extractive summaries often\ntimes give better results compared to automatic abstractive sum-\nrmaries (24). This is because of the fact that abstractive summa-\ntization methods cope with problems such as semantic represen-\ntation, inference and natural language generation which are rela-\ntively harder than data-driven approaches such as sentence extrac-\ntion. Asa matter of fact, there is no completely abstractive summa-\ntization system today. Existing abstractive summarizers often rely\n\u2018on an extractive preprocessing component to produce the abstract\nof the text (11, 33]\nConsequently, inthis paper we focus on extractive summariza~\ntion methods and provide an overview of some of the most dom-\ninant approaches in this category. There are a number of papers\nthat provide extensive overviews of text summarization techniques\nand systems (37,46, 58, 67].\n2 EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION\nAsmentioned before, extractive summarization techniques produce\nsummaries by choosing a subset of the sentences \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Based on the information provided from the document chunks, we have a clear understanding that the paper is about automatic text summarization techniques, their history, challenges, and the different approaches such as extractive and abstractive summarization. To create a sensational tabloid-style report for the general public, we need to craft a narrative that emphasizes the revolutionary aspect of these technologies and their impact on how we handle the overwhelming amount of information in the digital age. The journalist function has already been used to generate a short, sensational style report on the subject. Now, I will use the journalist function again to create a longer, more detailed report that can be published in the tabloid, providing readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the topic while maintaining the sensational style that engages the audience.\n\nAction: journalist(\"explosion of text data and automatic summarization techniques\", \"sensational\", \"long\", \"English\")</s>"}
