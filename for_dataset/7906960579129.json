Introduction\nFine particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter less\nthan 25 ym (PMp.) is an important air pollutant due to its ef-\nfect on human health, contribution to visibility reduction and\nimpact on climate (Fuzzi et al, 2015). Outdoor air pollution,\nincluding PM,., leads to approximately 3.3 million premature\ndeaths per year worldwide while the excess mortality rate in\nEurope has been estimated to be approximately 790,000 per\nyear (Lelieveld et al., 2015, \n- Action 4: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/16.pdf', 2]\nOutput: 2029).\nInthe atmosphere, aerosols have a wide variety of sources,\nwhich influences their concentration, size distribution and\nchemical composition. Aerosols can be classified, accord-\ning to their sources and their formation processes, as nat-\nural or anthropogenic and as primary or secondary (Fuzzi\ncet al, 2015). Natural aerosol sources include windblown soil\nfrom arid regions, volcanic emissions, sea spray, biogenic sec-\n\u2018ondary aerosol formation, and biomass burning from wild\nfires. The major sources of anthropogenic aerosols include\nfossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, waste incinera-\ntion, etc. smaeilirad et al, 2020) Primary aerosols are directly\nemitted into the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic\nsources, while secondary aerosols are formed through chem-\nical reactions in the atmosphere.\nAlthough air quality has improved in many developed\ncountries, the Mediterranean Basin still suffers from seri-\ncous air pollution. Positioned at the intersection of circulating\nair masses from three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa)\nthe Eastern Mediterranean countries are characterized by el-\nevated PM concentrations due to both locally emitted and\nlong-range transport, the absence of precipitation from spring\nto late autumn and favorable meteorological conditions for\nthe formation of photochemical smog (Mantas et al., 2014;\nRemoundaki et al, 2013; Pikridas et al, 2018). Lebanon is lo-\ncated along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and\nrepresents one Middle Eastern country where PM levels have\nbeen found to regularly surpass the World Health Organiza\ntion (WHO) standards (LNSAQM, 2017); the average concen-\ntrations of PM; were six to ten times higher than the maxi-\nmum mean yearly guidelines set by WHO (5 p/m?) (Abdallah\ncet al,,2018; Borgie etal, 2016; WHO, 2021). Long-range trans-\nport of dust from deserts in the fall and spring seasons (Sal-\niba et al, 2007) and potential sulfate from Eastern and Cen-\ntral Europe (Aff et al., 2008) contribute to elevated PM con-\ncentrations. Other significant local sources of pollution are\nroad transport, industrial emissions, and electricity produc\ntion (Waked et al, 2012; Waked and Afif, 2012). \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify all possible spelling mistakes, I will need to read through the entire document. Since the document is divided into chunks, I will systematically read each chunk and identify any spelling errors. I have already read the first three chunks (0, 1, and 2), so I will continue with the next chunk, which is chunk number 3.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/16.pdf', 3)</s>"}
