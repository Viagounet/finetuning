Energy\nefficiency-related actions could play an important role in\nachieving climate mitigation goals and sustainable develop-\nment targets [2]. Among the Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) of the United Nations, energy and climate activities are\nseen as essential objectives [3]. In particular, SDG 13 promotes\nefforts toward climate action, in accordance with the Paris\nAgreement. Improvements in energy efficiency and sustain-\nable infrastructures are the core of SDG 7, dealing with the\n\u201cpromotion of affordable and clean energy\u2019 [1,5]. The SDG 9\ntargets aim to develop resilient infrastructures and sustainable\nindustrialization, employing innovation. Nowadays, these ac-\ntions have been also considered potential key factors to tackle\nthe energy issues raised during the COVID-19 emergency [5,7]\n\u2018This is especially due to the problems related to pollution,\nincluding climate change and the high emission of carbon di-\noxide into the air, together with other polluting elements, the\ncauses of which are various and which certainly include the\nconsumption \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To provide a detailed summary of each main part of the document, I need to read the content of the document. Since the document is divided into chunks, I will sequentially read each chunk to understand the content of each section. Starting with chunk 0, which typically contains the introduction or abstract, I have already read. Now I will proceed with chunk 1, which seems to contain the beginning of the introduction and possibly the start of the literature review. This will help me to summarize the main parts of the document.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/14.pdf', 2)</s>"}
