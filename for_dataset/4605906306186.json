It also lists the authors and their affiliations, indicating a collaborative research effort from various institutions. The summary begins to outline the main findings of the study. To understand the overall structure of the document, I will read the entire document to identify the main parts, language, motivations, and the structure of the content.\n\nAction: read_document('/papers/papiers/11.pdf')</s>"}
