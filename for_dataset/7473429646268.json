The goal will be to produce energy in the cleanest way\npossible, and several states are undertaking important actions\ntomeet this goal [22,23]. Ibis therefore essential to improve the\ntechnologies that exploit renewable energy sources.\nLiterature review\nOur current economy, in the energy sector, is in most coun-\ntries still mainly based on fossil fuels, utitis already possible\nto define a primordial \u201ciydrogen Economy\u201d [2], as there are\nalready the technologies necessary for its production and\nconsumption [25,25]. It is necessary to ensure that hydrogen\ncan be available to the final consumer, conveniently and\nsafely, so that itis possible to define areal Hydrogen Economy\nbh\nThe objectives of reducing polluting gases in the atmo-\nsphere set by various governments and the attention that the\npopulation increasingly pays to environmental issues can\nfacilitate the expansion of a Hydrogen Economy [28-20]. To\ndate, the lack of incentives on national energy policies slows\ndown investments in hydrogen butin the future, they could be\nfundamental to the development of technologies related to\nthis alternative fue [51,22] Europe, one ofthe continents most\nengaged in environmental issues, needs policies to promote\nand support technologies that use hydrogen as an alternative\nfuel that limits dependence on fossil fuels, to ake progress in\nthe adoption of an Economy of Hydrogen. The production of\nhydrogen on our continent would also favor the creation of\nnew jobs as most fossil fuels are extracted and processed\noutside of Europe. Between 660,000 and 1.1 million new jobs\n(net of the entire workforce) could be created by 2030 and\nbetween 19 and 2:3 million by 2050 [23]\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the plans and\nstrategies of the various world powers: all are interested in\n\u201cclean\u201d hydrogen, whose global market value should reach\n191.8 billion dollars in 2024 [3] The European Union aims to\nbe the worlds first zero-emission continent by 2050. The Eu-\nropean Commission, in the Next Generation EU (Recovery\nFund worth 750 billion euros), places the fight against climate\nchange at the centre ofthe recovery from the crisis started by\nCovid-19 [35].\nThe \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: In the previous chunk (chunk 4), there were several spelling mistakes identified, such as \"energiesare\" (should be \"energies are\"), \"tomeet\" (should be \"to meet\"), \"Ibis\" (should be \"This\"), \"utitis\" (should be \"but it is\"), \"iydrogen\" (should be \"Hydrogen\"), \"itis\" (should be \"it is\"), \"bh\" (seems out of place or a typo), \"ake\" (should be \"make\"), \"fue\" (should be \"fuel\"), and \"2:3\" (should be \"2.3\"). To continue identifying spelling mistakes, I will read the next chunk of the document.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/14.pdf', 5)</s>"}
