{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to You're a highly competent journalist, write a report about the paper, for fellow scientists.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/1.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The paper is published in the Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2023.\n- The paper focuses on estimating the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model.\n- The authors are Alexandra Sasha Luccioni, Sylvain Viguier, and Anne-Laure Ligozat.\n- The paper discusses the environmental cost of training ML models, specifically the carbon emissions from training and deploying BLOOM.\n- BLOOM's training emitted approximately 24.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent considering only dynamic power consumption, and 50.5 tonnes when including all processes.\n- The study also examines the energy requirements and carbon emissions during the deployment phase of BLOOM.\n- The paper highlights the challenges in accurately estimating the carbon footprint of ML models and suggests future research directions for better reporting of carbon emissions.\n- Related work includes empirical studies on ML CO2 emissions, tools for estimating carbon impact, and additional factors contributing to the carbon footprint of ML.\n- The BLOOM model was trained as part of the BigScience workshop, utilizing significant computational resources.\n- The paper employs a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to estimate the environmental impact of the BLOOM model.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- A detailed summary of the paper's methodology and findings, including any specific data or results not yet covered.\n- An analysis of the paper's discussion section, including the proposed future research directions.\n- A review of the paper's conclusion and any recommendations made by the authors.\n- Any additional relevant information from the remaining sections of the paper that would be important for fellow scientists to understand the full scope of the study.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_document\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/1.pdf']\nOutput: An error has occured: name 'folder' is not defined\n- Action 2: metadata\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/1.pdf']\nOutput: path: papiers/1.pdf\nwords: 6369\nletters: 44753\nchunks: 21\ndocument type: pdf\n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To provide a detailed summary of the paper's methodology and findings, I need to read the content of the document. Since the document is 21 chunks long, I will start by reading the first chunk to begin summarizing the methodology section. This will likely include an introduction to the methods used in the study.\n\nAction: read_chunk(\"papers/papiers/1.pdf\", 0)</s>"}
