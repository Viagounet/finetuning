In the present article, we aim to\nquantify the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model, across its life\ncycle. We estimate that BLOOM\u2019s final training emitted approximately 24.7 tonnes of COseq if\nwe consider only the dynamic power consumption, and 50.5 tonnes if we account for all processes\nranging from equipment manufacturing to energy-based operational consumption. We also carry out\nan empirical study to measure the energy requirements and carbon emissions of its deployment for\ninference via an API endpoint receiving user queries in real-time. We conclude with a discussion\nregarding the difficulty of precisely estimating the carbon footprint of ML models and future research\ndirections that can contribute towards improving carbon emissions reporting.\nKeywords: carbon footprint, language modeling, life cycle assessment, machine learning.\n1, Introduction\nClimate change is one of our generation\u2019s biggest challenges, impacting ecosystems and livelihoods\nacross the world; estimating and reducing our carbon emissions is an important part of mitigating its\nimpacts (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). According to recent estimates, the global CO; emissions\nof the information and communications technology (ICT) sector account for around 2% of global\nCO; emissions, but this figure is hard to estimate precisely given the distributed nature of global\ncomputing infrastructure (International Telecommunication Union 2020, Malmodin and Lund\u00e9n\n2018; Copenhagen Centre on Energy Efficiency. 2020), The infrastructure used for training and\ndeploying machine learning (ML) models contributes to this number, \n- Action 3: read_chunk\nArguments: ['/papers/papiers/1.pdf', 1]\nOutput: butthe exact extent of this\ncontribution is also unclear. In order to get a better grasp of the carbon footprint of the field, it is\n(\u00a92023 Alexandra Sasha Luccion, Sylvain Viguier, Anne-Laure Ligozat\nLicen\nhetp://jmlr.org/papers/v24/23-0069.html\nCC-BY 40, see https: //creativeconmons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Attribution requirements are provided at\nLuccion1, VicutER, LiGozat\ntherefore important to start systematically tracking the carbon footprint of ML models and algorithms\nand the main sources of emissions.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are among the biggest ML models, spanning up to hundreds of\nbillions of parameters, requiring millions of GPU hours to train, and emitting carbon in the process.\nAs these models grow in size - which has been the trend in recent years \u2014 itis crucial to understand\nto also track the scope and evolution of their carbon footprint. The current study describes the first\nattempt to estimate the broader carbon footprint of an LLM, including the emissions produced by\nmanufacturing the computing equipment used for its training as well as the model deployment via\nan API. The goal of our study is not to hone in on an exact number for the emissions produced,\nbut to provide estimates of the relative contribution of each step of the deployment process towards\nthe overall emissions of the model. We conclude with a discussion about the carbon emissions of\ndifferent LLMs as well as the BigScience workshop overall, and propose directions for future work\nto both quantify and report these emissions.\n2. Related Work\nThere are different aspects of the environmental impact of computing in general and machine learning\nin particular that are relevant to our study; we briefly describe existing relevant work in the paragraphs\nbelow.\nEmpirical Studies on ML CO; Emissions Most of the existing work in this area has been done\non estimating the CO\u00bb emissions incurred during model training. Starting with the seminal work\nof Strubell et al., who looked at the carbon footprint of training a Transformer model (2019), more\nrecent studies have also looked at other model architectures and their ensuing emissions (Patterson\net al,, 2021; Naidu et al., 2021), Other studies have pursued a broader analysis of trends in terms\nof the energy requirements and CO) emissions of ML models in general (Thompson et al., 2020\nWu \n- Action 4: read_chunk\nArguments: ['/papers/papiers/1.pdf', 2]\nOutput: etal., 2021, Patterson et al., 2022). While some studies predict a growth in terms of carbon\nemissions of ML models (Thompson et al., 2020), others have predicted that emissions will shrink in\ncoming years (Patterson et al., 2022); further work is therefore needed to get additional estimates\nfrom a broader variety of models and use cases.\n\u2018Tools for Estimating Carbon Impact Another relevant research direction has pursued the devel-\nopment of tools for estimating the CO> emissions of training ML models, resulting in several tools\ncreated for this purpose. Some of these run in parallel to model training code and track its energy\nconsumption and CO\u00bb emissions (e.g. Schmidt et al. (2021); Anthony et al. (2020)), while others\ncan be used post-training in order to produce a more high-level estimate of emissions (e.g. Lacoste\net al, (2019)). However, these tools remain seldom used for reporting the CO> emissions in ML\npublications, and a recent study has found that they vary significantly in terms of the estimates that\nthey produce (Bannour et al., 2021),\nAdditional Factors Complementary work has also been done on other contributions to the overall\ncarbon footprint of ML, ranging from the carbon footprint of in-person versus virtual conference at-\ntendance (Skiles et al., 2021) to the manufacturing of computing hardware (Gupta et al., 2021) as well\nas the life cycle analysis of the entire ML development and deployment cycle (Ligozat et al., 20211\nand the certification of ML systems according to their social and environmental impacts (Gupta et al.\n2020). Increasingly, scholars have adopted a broader perspective on considering the environmental\nimpacts of ML models, going above and beyond only the COp emissions of model training and\nESTIMATING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF BLOOM, 4 176B PARAMETER LANGUAGE MODEL\nconsidering aspects such as equipment manufacturing and deployment (Wu et al., 2021; Kaack et al\n2022). However, there is still a need for a common approach in terms of estimating and comparing\nthe carbon emissions of ML models which spans these different parts of the model life cycle.\n3.
