{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to identify all the possible spelling mistakes.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/2.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The user's goal is to identify all possible spelling mistakes in the provided text.\n- The text provided is from a scientific article related to carbon capture technology.\n- The text includes technical terms and references to chemical processes and components.\n- The text is from a PDF document, and I have read through four chunks of this document.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- I need to continue reviewing the text for any spelling mistakes.\n- I should provide a list of identified spelling mistakes from the chunks I have read.\n- I may need to read additional chunks of the document if available to ensure all spelling mistakes are identified throughout the entire document.\n- I should confirm whether the identified mistakes are indeed errors or if they are correct within the context of the scientific terminology used in the article.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/2.pdf', 4]\nOutput: (OH),which rapidly absorb CO, gastoform carbonate or\nbicarbonateionsasthe crossover species.

Since I have already read through chunk 4, I will proceed with chunk 5. This will allow me to review more of the document's content and identify any additional spelling mistakes.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/2.pdf', 5)</s>"}
