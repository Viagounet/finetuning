You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to identify all the possible spelling mistakes.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with.

Jing and McKeown\n(1999) point out that human summaries are often constructed from the source docu-\nment by a process of cutting and pasting document fragments that are then combined\nand regenerated as summary sentences. Hence a summarizer can be developed to\nextract sentences, reduce them by dropping unimportant fragments, and then use in-\nformation fusion and generation to combine the remaining fragments. In this special\nissue, Jing (2002) reports on automated techniques to build a corpus representing the\ncut-and-paste process used by humans; such a corpus can then be used to train an\nautomated summarize.\nOther researchers focus on the reduction process. In an attempt to learn rules for\nreduction, Knight and Marcu (2000) use expectation maximization to train a system\nto compress the syntactic parse tree of a sentence in order to produce a shorter but\n401\nComputational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 4\nstill maximally grammatical version. Ultimately, this approach can likely be used for\nshortening two sentences into one, three into two (or one), and so on.\nOf course, true abstraction involves taking the process one step further. Abstraction\ninvolves recognizing that a set of extracted passages together constitute something,\nnew, something that is not explicitly mentioned in the source, and then replacing them\nin the summary with the (ideally more concise) new concept(s). The requirement that\nthe new material not be in the text explicitly means that the system must have access\nto external information of some kind, such as an ontology or a knowledge base, and be\nable to perform combinatory inference (Hahn and Reimer 1997). Since no large-scale\nresources of this kind yet exist, abstractive summarization has not progressed beyond\nthe proof-of-concept stage (although top-down information extraction can be seen as\none variant).\n23 Multidocument Summarization\nMultidocument summarization, the process of producing a single summary of a set\nof related source documents, is relatively new. The three major problems introduced\nby having to handle multiple input documents are (1) recognizing and coping with\nredundancy, (2) identifying important differences among documents, and (3) ensuring,\nsummary coherence, even when material stems from different source documents.\nIn an early approach to multidocument summarization, information extraction\nwas used to facilitate the identification of similarities and differences (McKeown \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: I have read through chunk 4 of the document and identified a potential spelling mistake. The word \"summarize\" in the last sentence of the first paragraph should likely be \"summarizer\" to maintain consistency with the rest of the text. I will now proceed to read the next chunk of the document to continue identifying any spelling mistakes.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/12.pdf', 5)</s>"}
