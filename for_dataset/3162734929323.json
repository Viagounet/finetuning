We suggest that this green space demand evaluation model can\nserve as a reference for future policy making and be applied to other cities worldwide.\nof carbon\nKeywords: demand priority; green space; carbon storage; carbon emission; InVEST model\n1. Introduction\nClimate change has become a global issue due to carbon emissions in the wake of mod-\nernization and urbanization. Carbon dioxide (CO,) is a main greenhouse gas that is emitted\nprimarily due to the use of fossil fuels and deforestation worldwide [1,2]. Carbon storage\n(CS) involves making a carbon sink using plant photosynthesis, and the main type of space\nused for carbon storage is green space, which is organized with many different species of\nplants to absorb CO, [3]. With urban space expansion, the change in vegetation coverage\nand land use type significantly impact CS, which also significantly impacts soil quality,\nland productivity, agricultural production, and food safety, as well as regional ecology, the\nenvironment, human survival, and social and economic development. Moreover, efficiently\nestimating climate change mitigation and ensuring standardized protocols and enhanced\ndata quality are imperative in CS research, particularly when conducting an integrated\nassessment of land use changes and their influence. By scrutinizing historical changes\nfrom a contextual standpoint, valuable insights are gained for developing sustainable land\nmanagement strategies [4,5]. China's government has committed to reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.
