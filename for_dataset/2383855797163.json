Radev- Eduard Hovy'\nUniversity of Michigan USC/ISI\nKathleen McKeown\u2018\nColumbia University\n1. Introduction and Definitions\nAs the amount of on-line information increases, systems that can automatically sum-\nmarize one or more documents become increasingly desirable. Recent research has\ninvestigated types of summaries, methods to create them, and methods to evaluate\nthem, Several evaluation competitions (in the style of the National Institute of Stan-\ndards and Technology's [NIST\u2019s] Text Retrieval Conference [TREC]) have helped de-\ntermine baseline performance levels and provide a limited set of training material.\nFrequent workshops and symposia reflect the ongoing interest of researchers around\nthe world. The volume of papers edited by Mani and Maybury (1999) and a book\n(Mani 2001) provide good introductions to the state of the art in this rapidly evolving\nsubfield.\nA summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more\ntexts, that conveys important information in the original text(s), and that is no longer\nthan half of the original text(s) and usually significantly less than that. Text here is\nused rather loosely and can refer to speech, multimedia documents, hypertext, etc.\n\u2018The main goal of a summary is to present the main ideas in a document in less\nspace. If all sentences in a text document were of equal importance, producing a sum-\nmary would not be very effective, as any reduction in the size of a document would\ncarry a proportional decrease in its informativeness. Luckily, information content in a\ndocument appears in bursts, and one can therefore distinguish between more and less\ninformative segments. Identifying the informative segments at the expense of the rest\nis the main challenge in summarization.\nOf the many types of summary that have been identified (Borko and Bernier 1975;\nCremmins 1996; Sparck Jones 1999; Hovy and Lin 1999), indicative summaries provide\nan idea of what the text is about without conveying specific content, and informative\nones provide some shortened version of the content. Topic-oriented summaries con-\ncentrate on the reader\u2019s desired topics) of interest, whereas generic summaries reflect\nthe author's point of view. Extracts are summaries created by reusing portions (words,\nsentences, etc.) of the \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The first chunk of the document has been read, and I have identified a few potential spelling mistakes. However, to ensure that all possible spelling mistakes are identified throughout the entire document, I need to read each chunk of the document and check for spelling errors. Since the document has 18 chunks, I will proceed to read the next chunk and continue this process until all chunks have been reviewed.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/12.pdf', 1)</s>"}
