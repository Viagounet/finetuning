This paper instead discusses an unpredictable\nphenomenon that we refer to as emeryent abilities of large language models. We cousider an\nability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models,\ncannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of\nuch emergence raises the question of whether additional\nscaling could potentially further expand the range of capabilities of language models\n1 Introduction\nLanguage models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. It is now well-known\nthat increasing the scale of language models (e.g., training compute, model parameters, etc.) can lead to\nbetter performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown\nct al., 2020, inter alia). In many the effect of scale on performance can often be methodologically\npredicted via scaling laws\u2014for example, scaling curves for cross-entropy loss have been shown to empirically\nspan more than seven orders of magnitude \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify the main parts of the document, I will need to read through the content of the document. Since the document is divided into 49 chunks, I will start by reading the first few chunks to get an overview of the beginning sections, such as the abstract and introduction, which I already have some information about. Then, I will proceed to read the last few chunks to identify the concluding sections, such as the conclusion, future work, appendices, and references. This approach will help me outline the structure of the document without having to read through the entire content.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/5.pdf', 48)</s>"}
