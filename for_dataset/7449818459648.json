However, to understand the main parts of the document in detail, we need to read the content where the sections are likely to be defined. Since the document is structured in chunks and we have the metadata information that there are 62 chunks, we can proceed to read the chunks sequentially to find the main parts of the document. Starting with chunk 1 might give us the introduction or the beginning of the table of contents, which will help us identify the main parts of the document.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/14.pdf', 1)</s>"}
