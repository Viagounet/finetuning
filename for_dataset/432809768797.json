Since the conclusion is usually towards the end of the document but before the acknowledgments, it is likely to be in the chunk preceding the one provided (chunk 28). Therefore, I will read the previous chunk (chunk 27) to find the conclusion.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/2.pdf', 27)</s>"}
