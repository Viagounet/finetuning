For directair-capturetests, we\nused 400 ppm CO, (Airgas) asthe input source and increased thetotal\nair gas low to1,000 scemto ensuresufficient CO,.Atthesame time, we\nalso used a 6-cm* electrode to increase the total carbon-capture cur-\nrent for minimized measurement errorsin carbon-capture rates. For\nthe flue gas capture, a simulated flue gas (13.9% CO,, 78% 0,, 76.3% Ny\n\u2018and 2.0% H,0) was preparedas the gas input to atandem reactor sys-\ntem. The O, generated from the first reactor was further recycled to\nincrease the O, concentration duringthe capture process. Allgas flow\nrates were precisely controlled by the mass low controller (Alicat) and\ntheconcentration of the mixture wasmeasuredandrecordedbyaCO;\n\u2018meter (CO2Meter).

Since the document is divided into 29 chunks and the conclusion is typically at the end of a document, we should continue reading the subsequent chunks to find the conclusion. We will proceed with reading chunk 26, as this is the next chunk after the last one read.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/2.pdf', 26)</s>"}
