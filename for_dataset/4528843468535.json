The conclusion is typically towards the end of a document but before the references section. Since we have already checked the last two chunks and found references, I will now attempt to read chunk 20, which is the chunk immediately before the references section that starts in chunk 21.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/388.pdf', 20)</s>"}
