You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to Translate the conclusion into Spanish.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/12.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The user wants to translate the conclusion of a document into Spanish.\n- The document is a PDF with the path 'papiers/12.pdf'.\n- The document contains 4891 words, 38793 letters, and is divided into 18 chunks.\n- The chunks read so far (14, 15, 16, and 17) contain references and parts of a bibliography but do not appear to include the conclusion of the document.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- The actual conclusion of the document needs to be located and read.\n- Once the conclusion is identified, it must be translated into Spanish to fulfill the user's request.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/12.pdf', 13]\nOutput: Udoand Ulrich Reimer. 1997.\nKnowledge-based text summarization:\nSalience and generalization operators for\nknowledge base abstraction.

Since the conclusion is typically found towards the end of a document, but before the references, we should continue to move backward through the document to find the conclusion. The next logical step is to read chunk 11, as it precedes the chunks that have already been read.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/12.pdf', 11)</s>"}
