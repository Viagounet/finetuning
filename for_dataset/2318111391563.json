Under specific symmetric\nreductions on potentials, we can obtain reduced integrable equa-\ntions. Such typical examples include the nonlinear Schr\u00e9dinger\n(NLS) equations and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)\n\u2018equations. Integrable equations can often be solved by the inverse\nscattering transform [1,2], the Darboux transformation [3], and\nthe Hirota bilinear method [4], and their soliton solutions can\nbe presented explicitly [5,5]. \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The first chunk of the document provides the title, author information, abstract, and the beginning of the introduction. To understand the main parts of the document, we need to read more content, especially the beginning of each section, which typically outlines the structure of the document. Since we have the metadata indicating there are 31 chunks, we can proceed by reading several chunks to identify the main sections. I will read the next chunk to continue where the first chunk left off.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/13.pdf', 1)</s>"}
