Since the document has 24 chunks and we have not yet found the conclusion, it is likely to be in one of the last chunks that we have not read. The logical next step is to continue reading the remaining chunks in reverse order, starting with chunk 19 and moving backwards, until we find the conclusion.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/15.pdf', 19)</s>"}
