{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to identify all the possible spelling mistakes.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/12.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The user wants to identify all possible spelling mistakes in a document.\n- The document is a PDF file named '12.pdf' located in the 'papiers' directory.\n- The document contains 4891 words and 38793 letters, divided into 18 chunks.\n- The document type is PDF, and it is related to the topic of summarization in computational linguistics.\n- I have read through chunks 0 to 3 of the document.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- I need to continue reading the remaining chunks of the document to identify any spelling mistakes.\n- After reading each chunk, I should report any spelling errors found.\n- Once all chunks have been read and potential spelling mistakes have been identified, I should provide a comprehensive list of these errors to the user.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To continue identifying possible spelling mistakes in the document, I need to read the next chunk of the document since I have already read chunks 0 to 3. I will proceed with chunk 4 by using the read_chunk function.\n\nAction: read_chunk(\"papers/papiers/12.pdf\", 4)</s>"}
