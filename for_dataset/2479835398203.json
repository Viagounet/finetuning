{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to What are the main parts of the document?.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/12.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: - Learned in relation to the user's request:\n  - The document is a special issue on summarization in computational linguistics.\n  - It discusses the need for automatic summarization systems due to the growth of online information.\n  - Summaries are defined, and their main goal is to present the main ideas of a document in less space.\n  - Different types of summaries are mentioned: indicative, informative, topic-oriented, and generic.\n  - The document outlines summarization processes: extraction, abstraction, fusion, and compression.\n  - There is an overlap of text summarization with other fields like information extraction, automated question answering, and natural language generation.\n  - The document has numbered sections, with the first two covering an introduction and major approaches to summarization.\n  - Section 2.1 discusses single-document summarization through extraction, including early techniques and machine learning approaches.\n  - Section 2.2 discusses single-document summarization through abstraction, mentioning information extraction, ontological information, information fusion, and compression.\n  - Section 2.3 begins to discuss multidocument summarization, addressing redundancy, identifying differences, and ensuring summary coherence.\n\n- What is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n  - The remaining sections and subsections of the document need to be identified and summarized.\n  - The specific content and focus of each section and subsection should be provided.\n  - Any conclusions or final remarks in the document should be noted.\n  - The overall structure of the document, including the introduction, body, and conclusion, needs to be clarified.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify the remaining sections and subsections of the document, I need to continue reading the content of the document where the previous information left off. Since I know that the last information provided was about Section 2.3, which discusses multidocument summarization, I will proceed to read the subsequent chunks of the document to find out about the other sections and their content. I will use the read_chunk function to do this, starting with the chunk that follows the last one read.\n\nAction: read_chunk(\"papers/papiers/12.pdf\", 3)</s>"}
