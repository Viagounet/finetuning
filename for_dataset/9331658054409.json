Jing and McKeown\n(1999) point out that human summaries are often constructed from the source docu-\nment by a process of cutting and pasting document fragments that are then combined\nand regenerated as summary sentences. Hence a summarizer can be developed to\nextract sentences, reduce them by dropping unimportant fragments, and then use in-\nformation fusion and generation to combine the remaining fragments. In this special\nissue, Jing (2002) reports on automated techniques to build a corpus representing the\ncut-and-paste process used by humans; such a corpus can then be used to train an\nautomated summarize.\nOther researchers focus on the reduction process. In an attempt to learn rules for\nreduction, Knight and Marcu (2000) use expectation maximization to train a system\nto compress the syntactic parse tree of a sentence in order to produce a shorter but\n401\nComputational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 4\nstill maximally grammatical version. Ultimately, this approach can likely be used for\nshortening two sentences into one, three into two (or one), and so on.\nOf course, true abstraction involves taking the process one step further. Abstraction\ninvolves recognizing that a set of extracted passages together constitute something,\nnew, something that is not explicitly mentioned in the source, and then replacing them\nin the summary with the (ideally more concise) new concept(s). The requirement that\nthe new material not be in the text explicitly means that the system must have access\nto external information of some kind, such as an ontology or a knowledge base, and be\nable to perform combinatory inference (Hahn and Reimer 1997). Since no large-scale\nresources of this kind yet exist, abstractive summarization has not progressed beyond\nthe proof-of-concept stage (although top-down information extraction can be seen as\none variant).\n23 Multidocument Summarization\nMultidocument summarization, the process of producing a single summary of a set\nof related source documents, is relatively new. The three major problems introduced\nby having to handle multiple input documents are (1) recognizing and coping with\nredundancy, (2) identifying important differences among documents, and (3) ensuring,\nsummary coherence, even when material stems from different source documents.\nIn an early approach to multidocument summarization, information extraction\nwas used to facilitate the identification of similarities and differences (McKeown \n- Action 2: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/12.pdf', 5]\nOutput: and\nRadev1995). As for single-document summarization, this approach produces more of a\nbriefing than a summary, as it contains only preidentified information types. Identity of\nslot values are used to determine when information is reliable enough to include in the\nsummary. Later work merged information extraction approaches with regeneration of\nextracted text to improve summary generation (Radev and McKeown 1998). Important\ndifferences (e.g., updates, trends, direct contradictions) are identified through a set of\ndiscourse rules. Recent work also follows this approach, using enhanced information\nextraction and additional forms of contrasts (White and Cardie 2002).\nTo identify redundancy in text documents, various similarity measures are used.\nA common approach is to measure similarity between all pairs of sentences and then\nuse clustering to identify themes of common information (McKeown et al. 1999; Radev,\nJing, and Budzikowska 2000; Marcu and Gerber 2001). Alternatively, systems measure\nthe similarity of a candidate passage to that of already-selected passages and retain\nit only if it contains enough new (dissimilar) information. A popular such measure is\n\u2018maximal marginal relevance (MMR) (Carbonell, Geng, and Goldstein 1997; Carbonell\nand Goldstein 1998).\n\u2018Once similar passages in the input documents have been identified, the infor-\nmation they contain must be included in the summary. Rather than simply listing\nall similar sentences (a lengthy solution), some approaches will select a representa-\ntive passage to convey information in each cluster (Radev, Jing, and Budzikowska\n2000), whereas other approaches use information fusion techniques to identify repet-\nitive phrases from the clusters and combine the phrases into the summary (Barzilay,\nMcKeown, and Elhadad 1999). Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn (1999) describe the use of\nhuman-generated compression and reformulation rules.\nEnsuring coherence is difficult, because this in principle requires some understand-\ning of the content of each passage and knowledge about the structure of discourse.\nIn practice, most systems simply follow time order and text order (passages from\nthe oldest text appear first, sorted in the order in which they appear in the input).\nTo avoid misleading the reader when juxtaposed passages from different dates all\nsay \u201cyesterday,\u201d some systems add explicit time \n- Action 3: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/12.pdf', 6]\nOutput: stamps(Lin and Hovy 2002a). Other\n402\nRadev, Hovy, and McKeown Summarization: Introduction\nsystems use a combination of temporal and coherence constraints to order sentences\n(Barzilay, Elhadad, and McKeown 2001). Recently, Otterbacher, Radev, and Luo (2002)\nhave focused on discourse-based revisions of multidocument clusters as a means for\nimproving summary coherence.\nAlthough multidocument summarization is new and the approaches described\nhere are only the beginning, current research also branches out in other directions. Re-\nsearch is beginning on the generation of updates on new information (Allan, Gupta,\nand Khandelwal 2001). Researchers are currently studying the production of longer\nanswers (ie., multidocument summaries) from retrieved documents, focusing on such\ntypes as biographies of people, descriptions of multiple events of the same type\n(eg., multiple hurricanes), opinion pieces (e.g,, editorials and letters discussing a con-\ntentious topic), and causes of events. Another challenging ongoing topic is the gener-\nation of titles for either a single document or set of documents. This challenge will be\nexplored in an evaluation planned by NIST in 2003.\n2.4 Evaluation\nEvaluating the quality of a summary has proven to be a difficult problem, principally\nbecause there is no obvious \u201cideal\u201d summary. Even for relatively straightforward news\narticles, human summarizers tend to agree only approximately 60% of the time, mea-\nsuring sentence content overlap. The use of multiple models for system evaluation\ncould help alleviate this problem, but researchers also need to look at other methods\nthat can yield more acceptable models, perhaps using a task as motivation.\n\u2018Two broad classes of metrics have been developed: form metrics and content met-\nrics. Form metrics focus on grammaticality, overall text coherence, and organization\nand are usually measured on a point scale (Brandow, Mitze, and Rau 1995). Content is\nmore difficult to measure. Typically, system output is compared sentence by sentence\nor fragment by fragment to one or more human-made ideal abstracts, and as in in-\nformation retrieval, the percentage of extraneous information present in the system's\nsummary (precision) and the percentage of important information omitted from the\nsummary (recall) are recorded. Other commonly used measures include kappa (Car-\nletta 1996) \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To continue identifying possible spelling mistakes in the document, I will proceed to read the next chunk of the document, which is chunk number 7.
