You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to Translate the conclusion into Spanish.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/12.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The user wants to translate the conclusion of a document into Spanish.\n- The document is a PDF with the path 'papiers/12.pdf'.\n- The document contains 4891 words, 38793 letters, and is divided into 18 chunks.\n- The chunks read so far (14, 15, 16, and 17) contain references and parts of a bibliography but do not appear to include the conclusion of the document.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- The actual conclusion of the document needs to be located and read.\n- Once the conclusion is identified, it must be translated into Spanish to fulfill the user's request.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/12.pdf', 13]\nOutput: Udoand Ulrich Reimer. 1997.\nKnowledge-based text summarization:\nSalience and generalization operators for\nknowledge base abstraction.

Since the conclusion typically precedes the references in academic papers, I will continue to read the preceding chunks in reverse order until the conclusion is found.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/12.pdf', 12)</s>"}
