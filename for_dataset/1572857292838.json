Introduction\nClimate change has become a global issue due to carbon emissions in the wake of mod-\nernization and urbanization. Carbon dioxide (CO,) is a main greenhouse gas that is emitted\nprimarily due to the use of fossil fuels and deforestation worldwide [1,2]. Carbon storage\n(CS) involves making a carbon sink using plant photosynthesis, and the main type of space\nused for carbon storage is green space, which is organized with many different species of\nplants to absorb CO, [3]. With urban space expansion, the change in vegetation coverage\nand land use type significantly impact CS, which also significantly impacts soil quality,\nland productivity, agricultural production, and food safety, as well as regional ecology, the\nenvironment, human survival, and social and economic development. Moreover, efficiently\nestimating climate change mitigation and ensuring standardized protocols and enhanced\ndata quality are imperative in CS research, particularly when conducting an integrated\nassessment of land use changes and their influence. By scrutinizing historical changes\nfrom a contextual standpoint, valuable insights are gained for developing sustainable land\nmanagement strategies [4,5]. China's government has committed to reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. This goal is especially\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11199. hitps:/ /doi.org/10.3390/su151411199 bttps:/ /www.mdpi.com/journal sustainability\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11199\n20f 16\npertinent to the city of Guangzhou, which is one \n- Action 6: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/15.pdf', 2]\nOutput: ofthe most developed and densely pop-\nulated urban agglomerations in China. The expansion of built land in Guangzhou has\nmade it difficult to reduce carbon emissions (CEs) [6]. Moreover, rapid urban expansion\nhas negatively impacted green spaces, which has become an important factor limiting city\nsustainability [7,8]. This strays from the urban plan goal of creating livable, sustainable, and\nfunctional urban environments that meet the needs of the population. Despite urban plan-\nners noticing that built land expansion will harm CS, itis still common for urban planners\nto overlook the allocation of green spaces in favor of increasing prosperity, especially in\ndeveloping countries. Some studies have analyzed vegetation, land use, and management\nto inform sustainable urban planning using life cycle assessments to explore the transition\nfrom global urban green spaces to nature-based solutions. By assessing vegetation, species\ncomposition, and carbon sequestration potential, these studies provide insights into their\nrole in sustainability and climate change mitigation [9-11]. Therefore, this research on the\ndemand priority of green spaces is significant in promoting low-carbon cities.\nGreen space, carbon storage, and carbon emission are closely related. Firstly, CS\nstrongly depends on green space distribution. It can be regarded as the value of urban\nland with vegetation and is considered to be one of the most promising options available\nto reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere as a result of urban expan-\nsion [12-15]. It is also a way to mitigate the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the air\nreleased by burning fossil fuels and other anthropogenic activities [16,17]. In addition,\nthe increase in atmospheric CO> caused by land use and land cover change (LUC) is\na driver of the increasing global climate. There should be a precise, accurate, and cost-\neffective method for measuring the quantity of CS [18-20]. INVEST (integrated valuation of\necosystem services and tradeoffs) is a suite of models that is used to calculate and evaluate\nnatural goods and services that sustain and fulfill human life [16]. Furthermore, green\nspaces are the main type of space used to remove atmospheric CO). CEs, primarily from\nthe combustion of fossil fuels, have risen dramatically since the start of the industrial\nrevolution. Matching the demand for CS and green space is the main way to reduce CEs.\n\u2018The existing research on the demand for green spaces mainly focuses on the social aspect\nto judge \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify all possible spelling mistakes in the document, I will need to read through the entire content.
