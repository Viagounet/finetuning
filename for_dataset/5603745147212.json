Since conclusions are typically located towards the end of a document, and we have been reading the last chunks which contain references, it is likely that the conclusion is located in one of the chunks just before the references section. Therefore, the next logical step is to read the chunk preceding the ones already read, which is chunk 56, in the hope of finding the conclusion there.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/14.pdf', 56)</s>"}
