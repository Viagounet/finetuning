Since the conclusion was not found in chunks 19, 20, 21, 22, or 23, it is logical to go backwards and check the earlier chunks. The conclusion is typically located towards the end of the document but before the references and acknowledgments. Therefore, I will attempt to read chunk 18, which precedes the chunks that were already checked.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/388.pdf', 18)</s>"}
