Introduction and Definitions\nAs the amount of on-line information increases, systems that can automatically sum-\nmarize one or more documents become increasingly desirable. Recent research has\ninvestigated types of summaries, methods to create them, and methods to evaluate\nthem, Several evaluation competitions (in the style of the National Institute of Stan-\ndards and Technology's [NIST\u2019s] Text Retrieval Conference [TREC]) have helped de-\ntermine baseline performance levels and provide a limited set of training material.\nFrequent workshops and symposia reflect the ongoing interest of researchers around\nthe world. The volume of papers edited by Mani and Maybury (1999) and a book\n(Mani 2001) provide good introductions to the state of the art in this rapidly evolving\nsubfield.\nA summary can be loosely defined as a text that is produced from one or more\ntexts, that conveys important information in the original text(s), and that is no longer\nthan half of the original text(s) and usually significantly less than that. Text here is\nused rather loosely and can refer to speech, multimedia documents, hypertext, etc.\n\u2018The main goal of a summary is to present the main ideas in a document in less\nspace. If all sentences in a text document were of equal importance, producing a sum-\nmary would not be very effective, as any reduction in the size of a document would\ncarry a proportional decrease in its informativeness. Luckily, information content in a\ndocument appears in bursts, and one can therefore distinguish between more and less\ninformative segments. Identifying the informative segments at the expense of the rest\nis the main challenge in summarization.\nOf the many types of summary that have been identified (Borko and Bernier 1975;\nCremmins 1996; Sparck Jones 1999; Hovy and Lin 1999), indicative summaries provide\nan idea of what the text is about without conveying specific content, and informative\nones provide some shortened version of the content. Topic-oriented summaries con-\ncentrate on the reader\u2019s desired topics) of interest, whereas generic summaries reflect\nthe author's point of view.

Extraction is the process of identifying important material in\nthe text, abstraction the process of reformulating it in novel terms, fusion the process\nof combining extracted portions, and compression the process of squeezing out unim-\nportant material, The need to maintain some degree of grammaticality and coherence\nplays a role in all four processes.\nThe obvious overlap of text summarization with information extraction, and con-\nnections from summarization to both automated question answering and natural lan-\nguage generation, suggest that summarization is actually a part of a larger picture.\nIn fact, whereas early approaches drew more from information retrieval, more re-\ncent approaches draw from the natural language field. Natural language generation\ntechniques have been adapted to work with typed textual phrases, in place of se-\nmantics, as input, and this allows researchers to experiment with approaches to ab-\nstraction. Techniques that have been developed for topic-oriented summaries are now\nbeing pushed further so that they can be applied to the production of long answers\nfor the question-answering task. However, as the articles in this special issue show,\ndomain-independent summarization has several specific, difficult aspects that make it\na research topic in its own right.\n2. Major Approaches\nWe provide a sketch of the current state of the art of summarization by describing\nthe general areas of research, including single-document summarization through ex-\ntraction, the beginnings of abstractive approaches to single-document summarization,\nand a variety of approaches to multidocument summarization.\n2.1 Single-Document Summarization through Extraction\nDespite the beginnings of research on alternatives to extraction, most work today\nill relies on extraction of sentences from the original document to form a summary.\nThe majority of early extraction research focused on the development of relatively\nsimple surface-level techniques that tend \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Since the previous actions have provided a glimpse into the content of the document and a tabloid-style report has been generated, the next logical step is to provide a final answer to the user. The final answer will summarize the findings and the report created by the journalist function, giving the general public a sensational yet informative take on the topic of automatic summarization in information technology.\n\nAction: final_answer(\"Robo-Recap Revolution!
