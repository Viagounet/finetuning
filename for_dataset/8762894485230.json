However, limited research has evaluated green\nspace demand specifically in terms of carbon storage and carbon emissions. This study introduces\na novel methodological framework that aligns ecosystem service functions with both supply and\ndemand, considering carbon storage and carbon emissions as crucial perspectives. The goal was\nto develop a comprehensive approach to assess the matching between the supply and demand of\ngreen spaces based on their carbon-related ecosystem services. The following research questions\nwere developed to guide this study: (1) What are the spatial and temporal characteris\nstorage? (2) What are the spatiotemporal variations in carbon emissions on a city scale?

To continue identifying spelling mistakes, I will proceed to read the next chunk of the document. Since the document has 24 chunks and we have already read chunk 0, I will read chunk 1.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/15.pdf', 1)</s>"}
