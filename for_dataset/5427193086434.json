Since the document is divided into 24 chunks and the conclusion is typically found towards the end of a paper, it is likely that the conclusion is in one of the last chunks that have not been read yet. The next logical step is to read chunk 16, as it is the next chunk in reverse order that has not been reviewed.\n\nAction: read_chunk(\"papers/papiers/15.pdf\", 16)</s>"}
