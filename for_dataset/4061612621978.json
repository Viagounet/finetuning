The goal will be to produce energy in the cleanest way\npossible, and several states are undertaking important actions\ntomeet this goal [22,23]. Ibis therefore essential to improve the\ntechnologies that exploit renewable energy sources.\nLiterature review\nOur current economy, in the energy sector, is in most coun-\ntries still mainly based on fossil fuels, utitis already possible\nto define a primordial \u201ciydrogen Economy\u201d [2], as there are\nalready the technologies necessary for its production and\nconsumption [25,25]. It is necessary to ensure that hydrogen\ncan be available to the final consumer, conveniently and\nsafely, so that itis possible to define areal Hydrogen Economy\nbh\nThe objectives of reducing polluting gases in the atmo-\nsphere set by various governments and the attention that the\npopulation increasingly pays to environmental issues can\nfacilitate the expansion of a Hydrogen Economy [28-20]. To\ndate, the lack of incentives on national energy policies slows\ndown investments in hydrogen butin the future, they could be\nfundamental to the development of technologies related to\nthis alternative fue [51,22] Europe, one ofthe continents most\nengaged in environmental issues, needs policies to promote\nand support technologies that use hydrogen as an alternative\nfuel that limits dependence on fossil fuels, to ake progress in\nthe adoption of an Economy of Hydrogen. The production of\nhydrogen on our continent would also favor the creation of\nnew jobs as most fossil fuels are extracted and processed\noutside of Europe. Between 660,000 and 1.1 million new jobs\n(net of the entire workforce) could be created by 2030 and\nbetween 19 and 2:3 million by 2050 [23]\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the plans and\nstrategies of the various world powers: all are interested in\n\u201cclean\u201d hydrogen, whose global market value should reach\n191.8 billion dollars in 2024 [3] The European Union aims to\nbe the worlds first zero-emission continent by 2050. The Eu-\nropean Commission, in the Next Generation EU (Recovery\nFund worth 750 billion euros), places the fight against climate\nchange at the centre ofthe recovery from the crisis started by\nCovid-19 [35].\nThe \n- Action 2: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/14.pdf', 5]\nOutput: EUCommission itself signals the start of a clean\nhydrogen economy in Europe, together with renewable energy\nprojects, in particular, wind and photovoltaic; therefore, the\nEuropean Green Deal becomes essential in the European re-\ncovery strategy. The strategy envisages a progressive path,\nwith three phases of strengthening the clean hydrogen\neconomy [25,26], at different speeds in different industrial\nsectors.\n\u2018+ in the first phase (2020-24) the goal is to decarbonize the\nproduction of existing hydrogen destined for current uses,\nfor example in the chemical sector, and promote new ap-\nplications. This requires the installation in the EU of at\nleast 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers (currently\nthey have a capacity of around 1 GW) by 2024. At this stage,\nit aims to produce up to one million tons of renewable\nhydrogen;\nin the second phase (2024-20) the use of hydrogen will\ngradually be extended to new sectors, including rail\ntransport, the steel industry, and some maritime transport\napplications. Hydrogen must become an integral part of an\nintegrated energy system, ie. optimized in its various ele-\nments to minimize consumption, costs, and environ-\nmental impacts by maximizing energy autonomy: the goal\nis to install at least 40 GW of electrolyzers for renewable\nhydrogen by 2030 and produce up to ten million tons of\nrenewable hydrogen in the EU. Most of the products will\nstill take place near the user or renewable energy sources;\nin the third phase (between 2030 and 2050), technologies\nbased on renewable hydrogen should be applied on a large\nscale to reach all sectors that are difficult to decarbonize,\n\u2018where alternatives could have higher costs.\nConsidering this context, hydrogen could have significant\npotential as an energy carrier in several sectors [37,38], tack-\nling various critical energy challenges [39]. Its applications\ncontribute to decarbonize different sectors, guaranteeing an\neffective process with flexibility and high efficiency [40] and\nserving as long-term energy storage [41].\nPleshivtseva et al. [42] analyzed 383 hydrogen production\nprojects in 39 nations, basing their investigation on the IEA\ndatabase, and on projects from 2000 to 2030, analyzed in light\nof key factors. The findings demonstrate that key character-\nistics change significantly over time, mostly when programs\ndesigned \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Continuing from where the previous actions left off, I will read the next chunk of the document to identify any spelling mistakes.
