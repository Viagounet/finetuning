{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to You're a highly competent journalist, write a report about the paper, for fellow scientists.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/12.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The paper discusses the field of automatic summarization, its importance, and the various methods used to create summaries.\n- It defines a summary and describes different types of summaries, such as indicative, informative, topic-oriented, and generic summaries.\n- The paper outlines the processes involved in summarization: extraction, abstraction, fusion, and compression, and the need for grammaticality and coherence.\n- It highlights the overlap of text summarization with information extraction, automated question answering, and natural language generation.\n- The paper sketches the state of the art in summarization, including single-document summarization through extraction and the beginnings of abstractive approaches.\n- Early techniques for sentence extraction are discussed, including the use of features like position in the text, word frequency, and key phrases.\n- Machine learning's role in summarization is acknowledged, with examples of its application in feature identification and sentence selection.\n- Approaches using sophisticated natural language analysis to identify key passages are mentioned, focusing on lexical connectedness and discourse structure.\n- The paper references MEAD, an open-source summarization environment, and recent work using hidden Markov models and pivoted QR decomposition.\n- Abstractive approaches to summarization are categorized, including those using information extraction, ontological information, information fusion, and compression.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- Further details on the specific methodologies and algorithms used in the summarization process.\n- In-depth discussion on the effectiveness and challenges of the various summarization techniques.\n- The results of evaluation competitions and how they have influenced the development of summarization methods.\n- The potential future directions of research in the field of automatic summarization.\n- Any case studies or practical applications of the summarization techniques discussed in the paper.\n- The paper's conclusions and any recommendations for fellow researchers in the field.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To provide a comprehensive report for fellow scientists, I need to gather more detailed information about the methodologies, effectiveness, challenges, evaluation competitions, future research directions, practical applications, and conclusions of the paper. Since I have a summary of the paper's content, I will now use the `read_document` function to access the full content of the paper. This will allow me to analyze the paper in-depth and extract the necessary information to write a detailed report.\n\nAction: read_document(\"papers/papiers/12.pdf\")</s>"}
