To continue identifying all possible spelling mistakes, I will need to read the subsequent chunks of the document. Since the document has 59 chunks in total, I will proceed by reading the next chunk. I will use the read_chunk function with the document path and the next chunk number, which is 1, as the index starts at 0 and we have already read the first chunk.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/16.pdf', 1)</s>"}
