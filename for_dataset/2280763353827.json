{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to What are the main parts of the document?.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/4.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n\n- The document is a survey paper titled \"Text Summarization Techniques: A Brief Survey.\"\n- The authors are affiliated with the University of Georgia, and the paper appears to be related to computer science and information systems.\n- The paper discusses the explosion of text data and the need for effective summarization techniques.\n- It reviews various approaches to automatic text summarization, including their effectiveness and shortcomings.\n- The paper defines automatic text summarization and its challenges, and it provides a historical perspective on the development of summarization techniques.\n- Two main approaches to summarization are highlighted: extractive and abstractive summarization.\n- The focus of the paper is on extractive summarization methods, and it provides an overview of dominant approaches in this category.\n- The paper outlines three tasks that all summarizers perform: constructing an intermediate representation of the input text, scoring sentences based on this representation, and selecting a summary comprising a number of sentences.\n- It discusses different types of intermediate representations, such as topic representation and indicator representation.\n- The paper explains how sentences are scored for importance and how the top sentences are selected to form a summary.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n\n- The specific main parts of the document, such as the introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, etc., have not been explicitly identified.\n- The overall structure of the document, including section headings and subheadings, has not been provided.\n- A complete summary of the document's content, including all key points and findings, has not been compiled.\n- Any conclusions or recommendations made by the authors have not been summarized.\n\nTo fully fulfill the request, I would need to provide a structured outline of the document's main parts and a comprehensive summary of its entire content, including any conclusions or recommendations.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify the main parts of the document, I need to first understand its overall structure. This can be achieved by reading the content of the document. Since I do not have information about the length or structure of the document, I will start by retrieving the metadata to determine how to best approach reading the document. The metadata will provide details such as the number of pages and chunks, which will help me decide whether to read the entire document at once or to read it in chunks.\n\nAction: metadata(\"papers/papiers/4.pdf\")</s>"}
