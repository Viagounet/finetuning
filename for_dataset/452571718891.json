You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to Translate the conclusion into Spanish.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/10.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned:\n- The user's goal is to translate the conclusion of a document into Spanish.\n- The document is a PDF with the path 'papiers/10.pdf'.\n- The document contains 8913 words, 63529 letters, and is divided into 33 chunks.\n- The chunks read (30, 31, 32) contain references and a disclaimer/publisher's note, but do not appear to include the conclusion of the paper.\n- The conclusion of the paper has not yet been located within the document.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- The actual conclusion of the paper needs to be identified and read from the document.\n- Once the conclusion is located and read, it needs to be translated into Spanish to fulfill the user's request.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/10.pdf', 29]\nOutput: 228742,\n[CrossRef]\nPerry,D; Mamlouk, M.
