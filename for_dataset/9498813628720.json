It is likely that the conclusion is in the last chunk of the document, which would be chunk 24 given that there are 24 chunks in total (index starting at 0). Therefore, the next logical step is to attempt to read the last chunk of the document to find the conclusion.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/388.pdf', 23)</s>"}
