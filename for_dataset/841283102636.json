For directair-capturetests, we\nused 400 ppm CO, (Airgas) asthe input source and increased thetotal\nair gas low to1,000 scemto ensuresufficient CO,.Atthesame time, we\nalso used a 6-cm* electrode to increase the total carbon-capture cur-\nrent for minimized measurement errorsin carbon-capture rates. For\nthe flue gas capture, a simulated flue gas (13.9% CO,, 78% 0,, 76.3% Ny\n\u2018and 2.0% H,0) was preparedas the gas input to atandem reactor sys-\ntem. The O, generated from the first reactor was further recycled to\nincrease the O, concentration duringthe capture process.

Since the document is divided into 29 chunks and the conclusion is typically at the end of a document, the next logical step is to read the next chunk, which is chunk 27. If the conclusion is not in chunk 27, we will proceed to chunk 28, and if necessary, to the final chunk 29.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/2.pdf', 27)</s>"}
