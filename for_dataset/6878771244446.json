{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to You're a tabloid journalist, write a report about the paper, for the general public.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/1.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The paper is a study estimating the carbon footprint of BLOOM, a large language model with 176 billion parameters.\n- The study aims to quantify the carbon emissions from the entire lifecycle of BLOOM, including manufacturing of computing equipment and operational energy consumption.\n- The estimated carbon emissions for BLOOM's training are approximately 24.7 tonnes CO2-equivalent considering only dynamic power consumption, and 50.5 tonnes when accounting for all processes.\n- The study also examines the energy requirements and carbon emissions during the deployment phase of BLOOM for real-time user queries via an API.\n- The paper discusses the challenges in accurately estimating the carbon footprint of machine learning models and suggests future research directions for better emissions reporting.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- Specific details on how BLOOM's carbon footprint compares to other large language models or industry standards.\n- The broader implications of these findings on the AI industry and potential regulatory or policy responses.\n- The response from the creators of BLOOM or other stakeholders in the AI community regarding the study's findings.\n- Any proposed or ongoing initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint of AI models like BLOOM.\n- The potential impact of this revelation on public perception and the future development of AI technologies.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To begin crafting a tabloid-style report for the general public, I need to gather more specific details from the paper itself. This will help me understand the nuances of the study, such as how BLOOM's carbon footprint compares to other models, the broader implications, responses from stakeholders, and any initiatives to reduce carbon footprints. I will start by reading the document to extract key points that can be sensationalized for a tabloid article.\n\nAction: read_document(\"papers/papiers/1.pdf\")</s>"}
