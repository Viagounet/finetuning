Under specific symmetric\nreductions on potentials, we can obtain reduced integrable equa-\ntions. Such typical examples include the nonlinear Schr\u00e9dinger\n(NLS) equations and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)\n\u2018equations. Integrable equations can often be solved by the inverse\nscattering transform [1,2], the Darboux transformation [3], and\nthe Hirota bilinear method [4], and their soliton solutions can\nbe presented explicitly [5,5]. \n- Action 2: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/13.pdf', 1]\nOutput: TheRiemann-Hilbert technique [7]\nhas also become a powerful approach to integrable equations\nand particularly to their soliton solutions.

We assume that the compatibil-\nity condition of the two matrix spectral problems generates an\nintegrable equation\nuy, = K(u), (12)\nfrom the zero curvature equation\nU-Ve Fil, V] = 0, (13)\nwhere [-,-] denotes the matrix commutator. There is a kind of Lie\nalgebraic structures underlining zero curvature equations, which\nguarantees the existence of infinitely many symmetries for the\nassociated integrable equations. The adjoint Lax pair of the matrix\nspectral problems in (1.1) is defined as follows:\nid, = GU = $U(u, A), id, = OV = GV(u, 2). (14)\nThe corresponding compatibility condition yields the same zero\ncurvature equation as (1.3), and so, it does not bring any ad-\nditional equations. Both the Lax pair and the adjoint Lax pair\nform the basis for the subsequent analyses of Riemann-Hilbert\nproblems.\nA standard procedure for formulating Riemann-Hilbert prob-\nJems can be described as follows.

The equivalence\nbetween the matrix spectral problems in (1.1) with (1.5) and the\nmatrix spectral problems in (1.6) follows from the commutativity\nof A and B. The properties (det yr}, = (det yy}, = 0 are two\nconsequences of trP = trQ = 0. There exists a direct connection\nbetween the matrix spectral problems in (1.1) with (1.5) and the\nmatrix spectral problems in (1.5):\nO= WE.
