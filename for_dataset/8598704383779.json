Since the first chunk provided the title and some of the authors' affiliations, and the second chunk continued with more affiliations, I will now attempt to read another chunk to gather more information about the document's content. This will help me to understand the structure, motivations, language, and possibly the author's intent. I will choose a chunk further into the document to hopefully capture part of the main body or conclusions.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/388.pdf', 10)</s>"}
