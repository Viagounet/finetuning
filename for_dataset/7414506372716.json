Under specific symmetric\nreductions on potentials, we can obtain reduced integrable equa-\ntions. Such typical examples include the nonlinear Schr\u00e9dinger\n(NLS) equations and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV)\n\u2018equations. Integrable equations can often be solved by the inverse\nscattering transform [1,2], the Darboux transformation [3], and\nthe Hirota bilinear method [4], and their soliton solutions can\nbe presented explicitly [5,5]. \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To provide a more detailed summary of the document's content, I need to read more of the document. Since the document is structured into 31 chunks, I will continue reading the subsequent chunks to gather more information about the results, discussions, and conclusions presented in the paper. This will help me understand the depth of the content and the specific topics covered in each section.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/13.pdf', 1)</s>"}
