At present, electrochemical\nimpedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used in the study of battery-power impedance characteristics\nand battery-state estimation due to its advantage of nondestructive measurement. For this reason,\nthis paper summarizes the research progress of lithium-ion SOH estimation based on EIS in recent\nyears and details it layer by layer, mainly from two aspects: first, the quantitative relationship model\nbetween the characteristic parameters and SOH is established by constructing a frequency domain-\nequivalent circuit model. Secondly, we construct a quantitative relationship model between EIS data\nand SOH using the data-driven method. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of different\nmethods and estimation accuracy are analyzed and compared, and the future estimation of SOH\nbased on EIS is prospected.\nKeywords: lithium-ion battery; estimation of SOH; EIS; ECM; data-driven method; nondestructive\n\u2018measurement; frequency domain-equivalent circuit model\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, transportation electrification has developed rapidly worldwide, which\nhelps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate global warming. The lithium-ion\nbattery (LIB), as the main energy-storage device, is one of the key components of electric\ntransport systems.\nIn the practical application of lithium-ion batteries, the SOH of the battery is particu-\nlarly important. As one of the important performance parameters of the electric vehicle\nbattery, when the parameter shows that it has dropped to meet the normal demand, it\nis necessary to replace it with a new lithium battery in time to ensure the safe use of the\nelectric vehicle [1-1]. Because the process of battery degradation to failure is very complex,\nthere are many internal and external factors that affect lithium battery SOH, which brings\nmany difficulties to the research of lithium battery SOH [5-7].\n\u2018At present, SOH-estimation methods for lithium-ion batteries can be roughly divided\ninto battery-model-based estimation methods and data-driven estimation methods [8-1].\nEnergies 2028, 16, 5682. https:/ /doi.org/10.3390 /en16155682 bttps:/ /www.mdpi.com /journal energies\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5682\n20f19\n\u2018The commonly used battery SOH-estimation methods rarely take into account the electrode\ninterface reaction \n- Action 4: journalist\nArguments: []\nOutput: No output\n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify all possible spelling mistakes in the document, I will need to read through the entire content. Since the document is divided into chunks, I will systematically read each chunk and identify any spelling errors. I will start with the second chunk (index 1) because the first chunk (index 0) has already been read and I have identified the following possible spelling mistakes:\n\n1. \"S|\" - This seems like a formatting error at the beginning of the document.\n2. \"fates\" - This word is out of context; it might be a typo for \"dates\" or another word.\n3. \"Heal State\" - Should be \"Health State\".\n4. \"Lithum-lon\" - Should be \"Lithium-Ion\".\n5. \"Ips\" - This is likely a typo for \"https\" in the citation URL.\n6. \"Eitors\" - Should be \"Editors\".\n7. \"Catlos\" - Should be \"Carlos\".\n8. \"aticle\" - Should be \"article\".\n9. \"acces\" - Should be \"access\".\n10. \"Attbution\" - Should be \"Attribution\".\n11. \"htps\" - Should be \"https\".\n12. \"\u2018reativecommonsorg\" - Should be \"creativecommons.org\".\n13. \"Hlectrcal\" - Should be \"Electrical\".\n14. \"sew\" - This appears to be part of an email address; however, it could be a typo.\n15. \"Insitute\" - Should be \"Institute\".\n16. \"Cooperation\" - Should be \"Corporation\" if referring to a company.\n17. \"Bejing\" - Should be \"Beijing\".\n18. \"gdehycdqduedu.cn\" - This appears to be part of an email address; however, it could be a typo.\n19. \"wanglicheng@zjut.eda.en\" - This email address seems to contain a typo; it should likely end in \".cn\" instead of \".en\".\n20. \"extemal\" - Should be \"external\".\n\nNow, I will proceed to read the next chunk to continue identifying spelling mistakes.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/10.pdf', 2)</s>"}
