{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to Translate the conclusion into Spanish.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with.

Since we are looking for the conclusion to translate into Spanish, we should check the preceding chunks to find the actual conclusion. We will read the chunk before the last one, which is chunk number 60, as the index starts at 0.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/14.pdf', 60)</s>"}
