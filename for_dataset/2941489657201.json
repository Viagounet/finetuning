Energy\nefficiency-related actions could play an important role in\nachieving climate mitigation goals and sustainable develop-\nment targets [2]. Among the Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) of the United Nations, energy and climate activities are\nseen as essential objectives [3]. In particular, SDG 13 promotes\nefforts toward climate action, in accordance with the Paris\nAgreement. Improvements in energy efficiency and sustain-\nable infrastructures are the core of SDG 7, dealing with the\n\u201cpromotion of affordable and clean energy\u2019 [1,5]. The SDG 9\ntargets aim to develop resilient infrastructures and sustainable\nindustrialization, employing innovation. Nowadays, these ac-\ntions have been also considered potential key factors to tackle\nthe energy issues raised during the COVID-19 emergency [5,7]\n\u2018This is especially due to the problems related to pollution,\nincluding climate change and the high emission of carbon di-\noxide into the air, together with other polluting elements, the\ncauses of which are various and which certainly include the\nconsumption \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To create a sensationalized tabloid-style report, I need to gather more specific details and juicy tidbits from the paper that can be exaggerated or presented in an eye-catching manner. I will read more chunks of the document to find additional information that can be used to craft an engaging story for the general public. Since I already have the introductory information from the first two chunks, I will proceed to read further chunks to uncover more details about the technological concepts, the current state of hydrogen production and demand in Europe, and the potential impact of hydrogen applications in various sectors.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/14.pdf', 2)</s>"}
