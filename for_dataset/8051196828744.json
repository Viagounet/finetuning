We estimate that Amazonia carbon emissions increased from\n0.24+0.08 PgC y! 2010-18 mean to 0.44+0.10 in 2019 and 0.52+0.10 PgC y\" in 2020 (+\nuncertainty). The observed increase in deforestation were 82% and 77% (94% accuracy) and\nburned area of 14% and 42% in 2019 and 2020 compared to the 2010-2018 mean, respectively.\nWe find that the number of notifications of infractions against flora decreased by 30% and 54%\nand fines paid by 74% and 89% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Carbon losses during 2019-20\nwere comparable to the record warm El Nino (2015-16) without an extreme drought event.\nStatistical tests show that the observed differences between 2010-18 mean and 2019-20 are\nunlikely to have arisen by chance. The changes in Amazonia\u2019s carbon budget during 2019-20\nwere mainly due to western Amazonia becoming a carbon source. Our results suggest that a\ndecline in law enforcement led to increases in deforestation, biomass burning and forest\ndegradation which increased carbon emissions and enhanced drying and warming of the Amazon\nforests.\nIntroduction\nAmazonia hosts the largest tropical forest on the planet and has proven to be an important carbon\nsink in the recent past'~, This carbon sink is declining, mainly due to increased tree mortality!\nas a result of deforestation and climate change\u2018.

The first two chunks have been read, revealing the document's title and a summary of its content. The title suggests that the document is a scientific study on the impact of reduced law enforcement on carbon emissions in the Amazon. The summary and introduction provide an overview of the study's findings, including data on deforestation, fires, and carbon emissions. To further understand the document's content and structure, I will continue reading the subsequent chunks. This will allow me to provide a more detailed summary of the document, including its main parts, language, motivations, and authorship. The next logical step is to read the next chunk to continue piecing together the content of the document.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/11.pdf', 2)</s>"}
