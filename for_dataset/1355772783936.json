However, to understand the main parts of the document, we need to look further into the content. Since the document is divided into 29 chunks, it is likely that the main parts such as the abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, and references are spread out across these chunks. To continue identifying the main parts, I will read subsequent chunks of the document.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/2.pdf', 2)</s>"}
