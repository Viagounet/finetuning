This paper instead discusses an unpredictable\nphenomenon that we refer to as emeryent abilities of large language models. We cousider an\nability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models,\ncannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of\nuch emergence raises the question of whether additional\nscaling could potentially further expand the range of capabilities of language models\n1 Introduction\nLanguage models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. It is now well-known\nthat increasing the scale of language models (e.g., training compute, model parameters, etc.) can lead to\nbetter performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown\nct al., 2020, inter alia). In many the effect of scale on performance can often be methodologically\npredicted via scaling laws\u2014for example, scaling curves for cross-entropy loss have been shown to empirically\nspan more than seven orders of magnitude \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The first chunk of the document provided the title, authors, and an abstract which introduces the topic of the paper. It also begins with the introduction section. To understand the main parts of the document, we need to continue reading the content beyond the introduction. Since the document is divided into chunks, we can proceed by reading subsequent chunks to identify the main sections and headings that structure the document. The next logical step is to read the next chunk to continue where the first chunk left off.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/5.pdf', 1)</s>"}
