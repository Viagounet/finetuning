Energy\nefficiency-related actions could play an important role in\nachieving climate mitigation goals and sustainable develop-\nment targets [2]. Among the Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) of the United Nations, energy and climate activities are\nseen as essential objectives [3]. In particular, SDG 13 promotes\nefforts toward climate action, in accordance with the Paris\nAgreement. Improvements in energy efficiency and sustain-\nable infrastructures are the core of SDG 7, dealing with the\n\u201cpromotion of affordable and clean energy\u2019 [1,5]. The SDG 9\ntargets aim to develop resilient infrastructures and sustainable\nindustrialization, employing innovation. Nowadays, these ac-\ntions have been also considered potential key factors to tackle\nthe energy issues raised during the COVID-19 emergency [5,7]\n\u2018This is especially due to the problems related to pollution,\nincluding climate change and the high emission of carbon di-\noxide into the air, together with other polluting elements, the\ncauses of which are various and which certainly include the\nconsumption \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To provide a detailed summary of the methodology and analyses used in the paper, I need to locate the section of the document that discusses these topics. The table of contents provided in the previous chunk indicates that there is a section titled \"Methodology and analyses.\" Since the document is structured in chunks and the table of contents is usually at the beginning of the document, I will proceed to read the subsequent chunks to find the section on methodology and analyses.\n\nAction: read_chunk(papers/papiers/14.pdf, 2)</s>"}
