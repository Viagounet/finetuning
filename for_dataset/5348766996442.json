Although most systems use sentences as units, some work with larger passages,\ntypically paragraphs. Typically, a set of features is computed for each passage, and\nultimately these features are normalized and summed. The passages with the highest\nresulting scores are sorted and returned as the extract.\nEarly techniques for sentence extraction computed a score for each sentence based\nfn features such as position in the text (Baxendale 1958; Edmundson 1969), word\nand phrase frequency (Luhn 1958), key phrases (e.g, \u201cit is important to note\u201d) (Ed-\nmundson 1969). Recent extraction approaches use more sophisticated techniques for\ndeciding which sentences to extract; these techniques often rely on machine learning,\nto identify important features, on natural language analysis to identify key passages,\nor on relations between words rather than bags of words.\nThe application of machine learning to summarization was pioneered by Kupiec,\nPedersen, and Chen (1995), who developed a summarizer using a Bayesian classifier\nto combine features from a corpus of scientific articles and their abstracts. Aone et\nal, (1999) and Lin (1999) experimented with other forms of machine learning and its\neffectiveness. Machine learning has also been applied to learning individual features;\nfor example, Lin and Hovy (1997) applied machine learning to the problem of de-\ntermining how sentence position affects the selection of sentences, and Witbrock and\nMittal (1999) used statistical approaches to choose important words and phrases and\ntheir syntactic context.\n400\nRadev, Hovy, and McKeown Summarization: Introduction\nApproaches involving more sophisticated natural language analysis to identify key\npassages rely on analysis either of word relatedness or of discourse structure, Some\nresearch uses the degree of lexical connectedness between potential passages and the\nremainder of the text; connectedness may be measured by the number of shared words,\nsynonyms, or anaphora (eg., Salton et al. 1997; Mani and Bloedor 1997; Barzilay\nand Elhadad 1999). Other research rewards passages that include topic words, that is,\nwords that have been determined to correlate well with the topic of interest to the user\n(for topic-oriented summaries) or with the general theme of the source text (Buckley\nand Cardie 1997; Strzalkowski et \n- Action 2: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/12.pdf', 3]\nOutput: al.1999; Radey, Jing, and Budzikowska 2000).\nAlternatively, a summarizer may reward passages that occupy important positions\nin the discourse structure of the text (Ono, Sumita, and Miike 1994; Marcu 1997b). This\nmethod requires a system to compute discourse structure reliably, which is not possible\ninall genres. This technique is the focus of one of the articles in this special issue (Teufel\nand Moens 2002), which shows how particular types of rhetorical relations in the genre\nof scientific journal articles can be reliably identified through the use of classification.\nAn open-source summarization environment, MEAD, was recently developed at the\nJohns Hopkins summer workshop (Radev et al. 2002). MEAD allows researchers to\nexperiment with different features and methods for combination.\nSome recent work (Conroy and O'Leary 2001) has turned to the use of hidden\nMarkov models (HMMs) and pivoted QR decomposition to reflect the fact that the\nprobability of inclusion of a sentence in an extract depends on whether the previous\nsentence has been included as well.\n2.2 Single-Document Summarization through Abstraction\nAt this early stage in research on summarization, we categorize any approach that\ndoes not use extraction as an abstractive approach. Abstractive approaches have used\ninformation extraction, ontological information, information fusion, and compression.\nInformation extraction approaches can be characterized as \u201ctop-down,\u201d since they\nlook for a set of predefined information types to include in the summary (in con-\ntrast, extractive approaches are more data-driven). For each topic, the user predefines\nframes of expected information types, together with recognition criteria, For example,\nan earthquake frame may contain slots for location, earthquake magnitude, number of\ncasualties, etc. The summarization engine must then locate the desired pieces of infor-\nmation, fill them in, and generate a summary with the results (DeJong 1978; Rau and\nJacobs 1991). This method can produce high-quality and accurate summaries, albeit in\nrestricted domains only.\n\u2018Compressive summarization results from approaching the problem from the point\nof view of language generation. Using the smallest units from the original document,\nWitbrock and Mittal (1999) extract a set of words from the input document and then\norder the words into \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To continue identifying the main parts of the document, I will read the next chunk of the document.
