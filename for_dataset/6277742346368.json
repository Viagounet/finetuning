(38] was one the earliest works that\nleveraged this method by using frequency thresholds to locate the\ndescriptive words in the document and represent the topic of the\ndocument. A more advanced version of Luln\u2019s idea was presented\nin [22] in which they used log-likelihood ratio test to identify ex-\nplanatory words which in summarization literature ae called the\n\u201ctopic signature\u201d. Utilizing topic signature words as topic repre-\nsentation was very effective and increased the accuracy of multi-\ndocument summarization in the news domain (29). For more infor-\nmation about log-likelihood ratio test, see (46)\n\u2018There are two ways to compute the importance ofa sentence: as,\na function of the number of topic signatures it contains, or as the\nproportion ofthe topic signatures in the sentence. Both sentence\nscoring functions relate to the same topic representation, however,\nthey might assign different scores to sentences. The first method\nmay assign higher scores to longer sentences, because they have\n\u2018Text Summarization Techniques: A Brief Survey\n\u2018more words, The second approach measures the density of the\ntopic words.\n3.2 Frequency-driven Approaches\n\u2018When assigning weights of words in topic representations, we can\nthink of binary (0 or 1) or real-value (continuous) weights and de-\ncide which words are more correlated to the topic. The two most\ncommon techniques in this category are: word probability and TFIDF\n(Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency)\n3.2.1 Word Probability. The simplest method to use frequency\ncof words as indicators of importance is word probability. The prob-\nability of a word w is determined as the number of occurrences of\nthe word, f(w), divided by the number of all words in the input\n(ohich can be_a single document or multiple documents):\nfiw)\n\u2018Vanderwende et al. (75] proposed the SumBasic system which\nuses only the word probability approach to determine sentence im-\nportance. \n- Action 2: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/4.pdf', 5]\nOutput: Foreach sentence, Sj in the input, it assigns a weight\nequal to the average probability ofthe words inthe sentence:\nPw)\n@\nEwes, Pw)\nTrew eS \u00b0\nlS)\nwhere (5) i the weight of sentence 5,\nIn the next step, it picks the best scoring sentence that contains\nthe highest probability word. This step ensures that the highest\nprobability word, which represents the topic of the document at\nthat point, is included in the summary. Then for each word in the\nchosen sentence, the weight is updated:\nPnewli) = PotaliPota(wi) 6)\n\u2018This word weight update indicates thatthe probability ofa word\nappearing in the summary is lower than a word occurring once.\n\u2018The aforementioned selection steps will repeat until the desired\nlength summary is reached. The sentence selection approach used\nby SumBasic is based on the greedy strategy. Yih et al. (79] used\nan optimization approach (as sentence selection strategy) to max-\n{mize the occurrence ofthe important words globally over the en-\ntire summary. [2] is another example of using an optimization ap-\nproach.\n3.22 TRIDF. Since word probability techniques depend on a\nstop word list in order to not consider them in the summary and\nbecause deciding which words to put in the stop list is not very\nstraight forward, there is a need for more advanced techniques.\nOne ofthe more advanced and very typical methods to give weight\nto words is TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency)\nThis weighting technique assesses the importance of words and\nidentifies very common words (that should be omitted from con-\nsideration) in the document(s) by giving low weights to words ap-\npearing in most documents. The weight of each word w in docu-\nrent d is computed as follows:\n{D}\naw) = fal) oa \u00ab\narXi, July 2017, USA\nwhere fy(w) is term frequency of word w in the document d,\n\u2018fo(w) is the number of documents that contain word w and |D|\nis the number of documents in the collection D. For more infor-\nmation about TFIDF and other term weighting schemes, see (59}\nTFIDF weights are easy and fast to compute and also are good\nmeasures for determining the importance of sentences, therefore\nmany existing summarizers (2,3, \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To continue identifying possible spelling mistakes in the document, I will proceed to read the next chunk of the document.
