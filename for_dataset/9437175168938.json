{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to What are the main parts of the document?.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/12.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n\n- The document is a special issue on summarization in computational linguistics.\n- It discusses the increasing need for automatic summarization systems due to the growth of online information.\n- Summaries are defined and their main goal is described as presenting the main ideas of a document in less space.\n- Different types of summaries are mentioned, such as indicative, informative, topic-oriented, and generic summaries.\n- The document outlines the processes involved in summarization: extraction, abstraction, fusion, and compression.\n- It touches on the overlap of text summarization with information extraction, automated question answering, and natural language generation.\n- The document is structured with numbered sections, with the first two sections covering an introduction to summarization and major approaches to the task.\n- Section 2.1 discusses single-document summarization through extraction, including early techniques and more recent approaches involving machine learning and natural language analysis.\n- Section 2.2 begins to discuss single-document summarization through abstraction, mentioning information extraction, ontological information, information fusion, and compression as part of abstractive approaches.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n\n- The remaining sections and subsections of the document need to be identified to provide a complete overview of the main parts of the document.\n- The specific content and focus of each section and subsection should be summarized to give a comprehensive understanding of the document's structure and topics covered.\n- Any conclusions or final remarks made in the document should be noted to complete the summary of the main parts.\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify the remaining sections and subsections of the document, I need to continue reading the content of the document. Since I already have information about the first two sections and their subsections, I will proceed to read the subsequent chunks of the document to gather information about the remaining sections. I will use the read_chunk function to do this, starting from where the previous information left off, which seems to be around section 2.2. I will begin by reading the next chunk to continue summarizing the document's structure.\n\nAction: read_chunk(\"papers/papiers/12.pdf\", 2)</s>"}
