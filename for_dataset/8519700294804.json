However, the last chunk read (chunk 39) did not contain a clear conclusion statement. It is possible that the conclusion is in the last chunk or the one before it. Since we have already read chunk 39 twice and did not find the conclusion, the next logical step is to read the previous chunk (chunk 38) to see if the conclusion is there. If the conclusion is not in chunk 38, we may need to continue reading earlier chunks until we find it.\n\nAction: read_chunk(\"/papers/papiers/11.pdf\", 38)</s>"}
