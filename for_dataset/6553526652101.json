At present, electrochemical\nimpedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used in the study of battery-power impedance characteristics\nand battery-state estimation due to its advantage of nondestructive measurement. For this reason,\nthis paper summarizes the research progress of lithium-ion SOH estimation based on EIS in recent\nyears and details it layer by layer, mainly from two aspects: first, the quantitative relationship model\nbetween the characteristic parameters and SOH is established by constructing a frequency domain-\nequivalent circuit model. Secondly, we construct a quantitative relationship model between EIS data\nand SOH using the data-driven method. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of different\nmethods and estimation accuracy are analyzed and compared, and the future estimation of SOH\nbased on EIS is prospected.\nKeywords: lithium-ion battery; estimation of SOH; EIS; ECM; data-driven method; nondestructive\n\u2018measurement; frequency domain-equivalent circuit model\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, transportation electrification has developed rapidly worldwide, which\nhelps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate global warming. The lithium-ion\nbattery (LIB), as the main energy-storage device, is one of the key components of electric\ntransport systems.\nIn the practical application of lithium-ion batteries, the SOH of the battery is particu-\nlarly important. As one of the important performance parameters of the electric vehicle\nbattery, when the parameter shows that it has dropped to meet the normal demand, it\nis necessary to replace it with a new lithium battery in time to ensure the safe use of the\nelectric vehicle [1-1]. Because the process of battery degradation to failure is very complex,\nthere are many internal and external factors that affect lithium battery SOH, which brings\nmany difficulties to the research of lithium battery SOH [5-7].\n\u2018At present, SOH-estimation methods for lithium-ion batteries can be roughly divided\ninto battery-model-based estimation methods and data-driven estimation methods [8-1].\nEnergies 2028, 16, 5682. https:/ /doi.org/10.3390 /en16155682 bttps:/ /www.mdpi.com /journal energies\nEnergies 2023, 16, 5682\n20f19\n\u2018The commonly used battery SOH-estimation methods rarely take into account the electrode\ninterface reaction \n- Action 2: read_chunk\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/10.pdf', 2]\nOutput: informationand usually only estimate based on the external characteristics\nof the battery or the DC internal resistance [12]. However, when lithium-ion batteries are\ncharged and discharged, complex electrochemical reactions will occur at the internal electrode\ninterface, and the reaction results are closely related to the battery\u2019s SOH [13]. This shows\nthat the SOH of the battery can also be estimated by studying the relationship between the\nelectrode-interface information inside the battery and the battery state [4-18]. EIS, which\ncontains rich information on material properties, interface phenomena, and electrochemical\nreactions within the battery, can reflect the aging state of the battery from multiple perspectives\nand is considered an effective means of achieving SOH estimation [19-22]. Table 1 compares\nthe advantages and disadvantages of different methods.\n\u2018Table 1.

Therefore, this paper summarizes\nthe literature in this field in recent years from model-based and data-driven perspectives,\nrespectively, and then analyses and compares each method.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 summarizes \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify the main parts of the document, we need to continue reading the content of the document to confirm the titles and content of the remaining sections, such as Section 3, Section 4, and Section 5.
