This volume of text isan invaluable\nsource of information and knowledge which needs to be effectively\nsummarized to be useful. In this review, the main approaches to\nautomatic text summarization are described. We review the differ-\nent processes for summarization and describe the effectiveness and\nshortcomings of the different methods\nCCS CONCEPTS\n+ Information systems \u2014> Document topic models; Informa-\ntion extraction; Summarization;\nKEYWORDS\ntext summarization, knowledge bases, topic models\nACM Reference format:\nMehdi Allahyari, Seyedamin Pouriyeh, Mehdi Assefi, Saeid Safai, Eliza\nbeth D.Trippe, Juan B.

Since I have only seen the abstract and introduction from the first chunk, I will need to read more chunks to identify the main parts and subsections of the document. I will start by reading the next chunk to continue where the first chunk left off.\n\nAction: read_chunk('papers/papiers/4.pdf', 1)</s>"}
