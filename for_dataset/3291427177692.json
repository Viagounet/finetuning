{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to What are the main parts of the document?.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/5.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n\n- The document is a PDF with 12,275 words, 92,395 letters, and 49 chunks.\n- It is an academic paper titled \"Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models\" with multiple authors from Google, Stanford University, UNC Chapel Hill, and DeepMind.\n- The paper was published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research in August 2022 and discusses the phenomenon of emergent abilities in large language models.\n- The introduction section explains the concept of emergent abilities as abilities that are not present in smaller models but appear in larger models and cannot be predicted by extrapolating the performance of smaller models.\n- The paper defines emergence in the context of model scale, measured by training compute and the number of model parameters.\n- The authors survey emergent abilities observed in prior work and categorize them in settings such as few-shot prompting.\n- The paper aims to motivate future research on why such abilities are acquired and whether more scaling will lead to further emergent abilities.\n- The concept of emergence is discussed with a focus on language models, and the paper includes discussions on the factors that contribute to the emergence of abilities, such as the amount of computation, number of model parameters, and training dataset size.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n\n- The main parts of the document, such as the abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, and any appendices or references, have not been fully identified.\n- The specific content and structure of the sections following the introduction, such as the detailed discussion on few-shot prompting and augmented prompting strategies, are not yet summarized.\n- The conclusions drawn by the authors and any future work they suggest have not been covered.\n- The full list of emergent abilities discussed in the paper and how they are categorized has not been provided.\n- Any figures, tables, or data visualizations included in the document have not been described.\n- The appendices and references, which may contain additional information and context, have not been explored.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: read_document\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/5.pdf']\nOutput: An error has occured: name 'folder' is not defined\n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: Since the previous action to read the entire document resulted in an error due to a misdefined path, I will attempt to read the document again using the correct path. This will allow me to review the content of the document and identify its main parts.\n\nAction: read_document(\"papers/papiers/5.pdf\")</s>"}
