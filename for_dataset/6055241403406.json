{"prompt": "<s>### Instruction: Your role is to choose the corresponding function to answer the user query. You will be given a history of your previous actions and several other information in the input.\n### Input:\nYour goal is to I want you to identify all the possible spelling mistakes.\nTo achieve this goal you will make good use of the following functions:\n- final_answer(your_final_answer: str) -> str ; final_answer your final answer to the user\n- metadata(document_path: str) -> str ; metadata returns metadata about the document (type, number of pages, chunks, letters etc.)\n- read_document(document_path: str) -> str ; read_document will return the content of the document\n- read_chunk(document_path: str, chunk_number: int) -> str ; read_chunk will return the content of a document chunk (index starts at 0)\n- journalist(subject: str, style: str, length: str, language: str) -> str ; journalist will write a news report with great skill about any subject\n\nNote: You will not make use of composite functions.\nThe following are the files you can work with. Always write their full path.\n- papers/papiers/1.pdf\n\nHere is a summary of what happened before: What I've learned in relation to the user's request:\n- The user wants to identify all possible spelling mistakes in a document.\n- The document is a PDF titled \"Estimating the Carbon Footprint of BLOOM, a 176B Parameter Language Model.\"\n- The document has been partially read in chunks, and the text from these chunks has been provided.\n- There have been no specific actions taken yet to identify spelling mistakes in the text provided.\n\nWhat is left to answer to fulfill the request:\n- I need to analyze the text provided from the chunks of the document to identify any spelling mistakes.\n- If there are additional chunks of the document that have not been read, they would also need to be analyzed for spelling mistakes to complete the user's request.\n- A summary of all identified spelling mistakes should be provided to the user once the analysis is complete.\n\nThese were the previous actions & results :\n\n- Action 1: metadata\nArguments: ['papers/papiers/1.pdf']\nOutput: path: papiers/1.pdf\nwords: 6369\nletters: 44753\nchunks: 21\ndocument type: pdf\n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To identify spelling mistakes, I need to read the content of the document. Since the document has 21 chunks, I will start by reading the first chunk and then proceed to read each subsequent chunk, analyzing them for spelling mistakes. I will begin with the first chunk (chunk_number 0) and then continue with the next ones in subsequent actions.\n\nAction: read_chunk(\"papers/papiers/1.pdf\", 0)</s>"}
