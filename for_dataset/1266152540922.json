We estimate that Amazonia carbon emissions increased from\n0.24+0.08 PgC y! 2010-18 mean to 0.44+0.10 in 2019 and 0.52+0.10 PgC y\" in 2020 (+\nuncertainty). The observed increase in deforestation were 82% and 77% (94% accuracy) and\nburned area of 14% and 42% in 2019 and 2020 compared to the 2010-2018 mean, respectively.\nWe find that the number of notifications of infractions against flora decreased by 30% and 54%\nand fines paid by 74% and 89% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Carbon losses during 2019-20\nwere comparable to the record warm El Nino (2015-16) without an extreme drought event.\nStatistical tests show that the observed differences between 2010-18 mean and 2019-20 are\nunlikely to have arisen by chance. The changes in Amazonia\u2019s carbon budget during 2019-20\nwere mainly due to western Amazonia becoming a carbon source. Our results suggest that a\ndecline in law enforcement led to increases in deforestation, biomass burning and forest\ndegradation which increased carbon emissions and enhanced drying and warming of the Amazon\nforests.\nIntroduction\nAmazonia hosts the largest tropical forest on the planet and has proven to be an important carbon\nsink in the recent past'~, This carbon sink is declining, mainly due to increased tree mortality!\nas a result of deforestation and climate change\u2018.

Several studies have estimated that evapotranspiration is responsible for up to 50% of\nwater recirculation in Amazonian precipitation. Hydrologically, Amazonia is one of the three\nmain air upwelling regions in the tropics and rainfall in the whole basin averages about 2,200\nmm per year'*, Large-scale human disturbance alters these ecosystem-climate interactions. In the\nlast 40 to 50 years, human impact has increasingly affected Amazonia, resulting in a forest loss\nof around 18%, of which 14% has been converted mainly to agricultural land (89% pastures and\n10% crops)*.\nIthas been widely reported that illegal deforestation rose 80% since 2019\u201d, compared to the 2010-\n18 period as a result of changes in law enforcement policy. We analysed how these changes affect\nthe Amazonian carbon balance and how they are linked to deforestation and fire feedbacks.\nForest removal reduces evapotranspiration and rainfall while increasing temperature!S'8,\nAdditionally, regional deforestation followed by fires and selective logging causes degradation\nof adjacent forests, increasing vulnerability to fires'. Regional and global warming are\nsynergistic and mutually reinforcing.\nWe compared the mean Amazonian carbon balance over 9 years (2010-18)! with the subsequent\ntwo years (2019 and 2020). In this recent period, there has been an intense reduction in public\npolicies to control deforestation'\u00ae. We used deforestation data analysis map to georeferenced\ncarbon sources (limited to the Brazilian Amazon \u2014 PRODES), as well as fire spots incidence\n(Pan-Amaz6nia) and burned area, in addition to other parameters (see methods) to understand\nthe main factors responsible for converting the Amazonia into a carbon source.\nAtmospheric carbon vertical profiles\n76\n71\n78\n79\n80,\n81\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\nWe performed 742 vertical profiles (VPs) from 2010 to 2020, using small aircraft over four\nAmazon sites, representing large upwind regions (Extended Data Fig. 1), where the VPs reflect\nthe result of all carbon sources and sinks between the Brazilian Atlantic \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The previous actions have provided the beginning of the document, which includes the title, author affiliations, and the start of the summary and introduction.
