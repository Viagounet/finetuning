Energy\nefficiency-related actions could play an important role in\nachieving climate mitigation goals and sustainable develop-\nment targets [2]. Among the Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) of the United Nations, energy and climate activities are\nseen as essential objectives [3]. In particular, SDG 13 promotes\nefforts toward climate action, in accordance with the Paris\nAgreement. Improvements in energy efficiency and sustain-\nable infrastructures are the core of SDG 7, dealing with the\n\u201cpromotion of affordable and clean energy\u2019 [1,5]. The SDG 9\ntargets aim to develop resilient infrastructures and sustainable\nindustrialization, employing innovation. Nowadays, these ac-\ntions have been also considered potential key factors to tackle\nthe energy issues raised during the COVID-19 emergency [5,7]\n\u2018This is especially due to the problems related to pollution,\nincluding climate change and the high emission of carbon di-\noxide into the air, together with other polluting elements, the\ncauses of which are various and which certainly include the\nconsumption \n- Action 4: read_chunk\nArguments: ['/papers/papiers/14.pdf', 60]\nOutput: metallurgicalviewpoint for Finnish ecosystem.\nFuture Technol 2023;2:58-61. https://doi.org/10.55670/\nfpllfutech.2.14.\n[194] Thiyagarajan SR, Emadi H, Hussain A, Patange P, Watson M.\nA comprehensive review of the mechanisms and efficiency\nPlease cite this article as: Genovese M etal, Power-to hydrogen and hydrogen. to-X energy systems for the industry of the Future in\nEurope, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, https://doi.org/10.1016)jijhydene.2023.01.194\n\n24 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY XXX (XXXX) XXX\nof underground hydrogen storage.

I have already seen the beginning and the end of the document, which gave me an idea of the topics covered and the style of writing. However, to get a better grasp of the main parts, motivations, language, and authorship, I need to read more of the document's content. Reading the introduction and conclusion in full will likely give me a good overview of the document's purpose, scope, and findings. Therefore, I will use the read_document function to access the entire content of the document.\n\nAction: read_document('/papers/papiers/14.pdf')</s>"}
