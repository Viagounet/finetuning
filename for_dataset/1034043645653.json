We estimate that Amazonia carbon emissions increased from\n0.24+0.08 PgC y! 2010-18 mean to 0.44+0.10 in 2019 and 0.52+0.10 PgC y\" in 2020 (+\nuncertainty).

Carbon losses during 2019-20\nwere comparable to the record warm El Nino (2015-16) without an extreme drought event.\nStatistical tests show that the observed differences between 2010-18 mean and 2019-20 are\nunlikely to have arisen by chance. The changes in Amazonia\u2019s carbon budget during 2019-20\nwere mainly due to western Amazonia becoming a carbon source. Our results suggest that a\ndecline in law enforcement led to increases in deforestation, biomass burning and forest\ndegradation which increased carbon emissions and enhanced drying and warming of the Amazon\nforests.\nIntroduction\nAmazonia hosts the largest tropical forest on the planet and has proven to be an important carbon\nsink in the recent past'~, This carbon sink is declining, mainly due to increased tree mortality!\nas a result of deforestation and climate change\u2018.

The cause? A shocking decline in law enforcement that has left the rainforest vulnerable to the voracious appetite of illegal loggers and land-grabbers.\n\nAs the guardians of the forest fall away, the trees that have stood for centuries, the silent sentinels that have tirelessly scrubbed our air clean, are being felled at a rate that sends shivers down the spine of environmentalists worldwide. The Amazon, a critical carbon sink, is now on the brink of becoming a carbon bomb, with emissions from the forest now outpacing its ability to absorb CO2.\n\nThis is not just an environmental crisis; it is a ticking time bomb for global climate chaos. With each passing day, the Amazon's capacity to regulate our climate is being undermined, and the effects will be felt from the bustling cities of the Northern Hemisphere to the most remote corners of the globe.\n\nThe world watches in horror as the emerald jewel of our planet is plundered, its protectors outgunned and outmaneuvered by the relentless forces of destruction. The question on everyone's lips: Can we afford to stand by while the Amazon burns and our planet's future hangs in the balance?\n\nThe time for action is now. The world must rally, and the clarion call for the Amazon's salvation must be sounded before it's too late. Will we rise to the challenge, or will we be the generation that stood by as the Earth's greatest natural treasure was reduced to ashes? The choice is ours, and the clock is ticking.\n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: The sensational style report generated by the journalist function provides a gripping and emotionally charged narrative about the decline in law enforcement leading to increased carbon emissions in the Amazon. To further enhance the report and provide additional details that could be included in the tabloid article, I will read another chunk of the document. This will allow me to gather more specific information and facts to support the narrative and potentially include quotes or data points that can make the article more informative and engaging for the general public.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/11.pdf', 2)</s>"}
