Accord-\ning to Radef et al. (53] a summary is defined as \u201ca text that is pro-\nduced from one or more texts that conveys important information\nin the original texts), and that is no longer than half of the original\ntext(s) and usualy, significantly less than that\u201d\n\u2018Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise\nand fluent summary while preserving key information content and\noverall meaning. In recent years, numerous approaches have been\ndeveloped for automatic text summarization and applied widely in\nvarious domains. For example, search engines generate snippets\nas the previews of the documents (73). Other examples include\nnews websites which produce condensed descriptions of news top-\nics usually as headlines to facilitate browsing or knowledge extrac-\ntive approaches (8, 61,72}\n\u2018Automatic text summarizationis very challenging, because when\n\u2018weas humans summarize apiece of text, we usually read it entirely\ntodevelop our understanding, and then write a summary highlight-\ning its main points, Since computers lack human knowledge and\nlanguage capability, it makes automatic text summarization a very\ndifficult and non-trivial task.\n\u2018Automatic text summarization gained attraction as early asthe\n1950s. An important research of these days was (38] for summariz~\ning scientific documents. Luhn et al. (38] introduced a method to\nextract salient sentences from the text using features such as word\nand phrase frequency. They proposed to weight the sentences of\na document as a function of high frequency words, ignoring very\nhigh frequency common words. Edmundson etal. (23] described a\nparadigm based on key phrases which in addition to standard fre~\nquency depending weights, used the following three methods to\ndetermine the sentence weight:\n(1) Cue Method: The relevance ofa sentence \n\n---\nYou will now answer with an action (using a function) by precisely following this template :\n\nExplaination: Replace this text with your reasoning behind your action choice.\nAction: function(argument1, ...)\n\n### Response:\nExplanation: To write a comprehensive report for fellow scientists, I need to gather more information about the paper's content, structure, and key findings. Since the document appears to be a survey on text summarization techniques, it is important to understand the various methods discussed, their effectiveness, and any shortcomings or future directions mentioned by the authors. Reading additional chunks of the document will provide a broader understanding of the paper's content, which is necessary to write an accurate and informative report.\n\nAction: read_chunk('/papers/papiers/4.pdf', 2)</s>"}
